    <title>The Complete Guide to Mid-Range Glazes by John Britt</title>
    <link>https://wiki.glazy.org/t/the-complete-guide-to-mid-range-glazes-by-john-britt/123</link>
    <description>&gt; According to Ceramics Monthly, approximately 75% of potters glaze their pieces at mid-range temperatures—and this complete studio guide eliminates the guesswork from the popular process. Along with over 400 hundred recipes, it explores mixing, application, specific firing and cooling cycles, and all the factors that make glazes work. See how to boost colors with intense stains, washes, and underglazes; achieve stunning results that equal high-fire glazing, and expand the frontiers of mid-range with tips for wood, salt, and soda firing.
