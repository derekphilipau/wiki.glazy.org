    <description>EDIT:  No longer used in preference for Discourse.

EDIT: I&#39;ve taken down the site for now out of concerns about the approach. See conversation below!
I uploaded the &quot;Clay Bodies&quot; section of the Clayart archives into an open-source project called Bookstack (https://www.bookstackapp.com/).
Bookstack is a VERY simple Wiki/Book/Documentation app. It allows for Facebook/Google login and uses WYSIWYG text editing.
The test website doesn&#39;t require login, just click &quot;Edit&quot; to edit a page.

(The email archives are organized by threads visible in the &quot;Page Navigation&quot;, unfortunately the subjects of threads are often changed, and therefore it&#39;s messy.)</description>
