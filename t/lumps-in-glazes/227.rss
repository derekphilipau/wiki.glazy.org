    <description>## Does your glaze contain Zinc Oxide?

Dick White via Ceramic Recipes: 
&gt; The issue is that zinc oxide absorbs moisture from the air if it is not in a completely sealed container. That plumps up the grains and they stick together in those hard granules. You can also calcine it to 8-900F (450C) to dry it out and then grind it.

&gt; I have found that once in the slurry, a blender just swirls it around without breaking the lumps. I don&#39;t think it would work to &quot;blend&quot; it dry, but haven&#39;t actually tried that.

 _If you calcine it, how does that affect the weight?_
&gt; As it stands, the zinc oxide weighs more than it should because of the absorbed water, so you are putting less zinc into the recipe (and even less because you can&#39;t get it through the sieve). Calcining it will return it to its proper molecular weight.

Mike Mangion via Ceramic Recipes:
&gt; I&#39;m in agreeance with Dick, calcining it to around 840F (450C) will help the process of breaking it apart with either a mortar &amp; pestle, grinder or in a ball mill. I understand your pain given all my glazes (Macro crystalline) use around 25% Zinc oxide.
&gt; You also will be best to make a calcining pot and a big cookie jar (just bisque fired) for storing Zinc and other calcined materials, plus materials that can absorb moisture and clump over time.

## Was your glaze properly sieved and mixed?

Glazes with a lot of clay should be sieved at least twice through at least 80-mesh screens and mixed after each pass through the sieve.  In glazes that are not thoroughly mixed, the clays can still bunch together in small lumps, ruining the glaze surface.

## Was your glaze properly stirred before application?

All glazes should be gently stirred to eliminate all clumps before application.
