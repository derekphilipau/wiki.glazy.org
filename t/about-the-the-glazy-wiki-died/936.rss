    <title>About the The Glazy Wiki Died :(</title>
    <link>https://wiki.glazy.org/t/about-the-the-glazy-wiki-died/936</link>
    <description>This Discourse Wiki was an attempt to provide a home for Glazy&#39;s documentation as well as support and discussion related to glaze chemistry.  Unfortunately it didn&#39;t work out.

You can now have discussions directly in Glazy, just go to https://glazy.org/ and create a new Post.</description>
