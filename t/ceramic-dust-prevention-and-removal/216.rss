## Preventing dust creation
The best way to keep from having troubles with dust in the studio is to keep form making dust. While this is not always possible, many things can be done to minimize dust creation.

* Use wet cleaning techniques whenever possible.
* Do not use brooms or brushes for cleaning.
* Allow glaze and clay materials to slake in a covered container before mixing.
* Minimize the use of canvas covered tables. 
* Keep ware boards tables and shelves clean.
* Annually wet clean every horizontal surface in the studio.
* Mix clay outside if possible.
* Studios with dry clay floors may find that application of deliquescent salts to the floors, such as calcium chloride, may help to control dust.

## Removing dust at its source**
In general if the creation of dust cannot be prevented it is best to remove it at its source. 
* Mount a vent directly on clay mixers to create enough negative pressure that the dust is kept from entering the general room air. If you cannot afford a large enough dust removal apparatus consider the safety of venting it outside. Make sure that the vent exhaust is not picked up by a building air intake.

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicosis" target="_blank">Silicosis</a></h3>

<p>Silicosis is a form of occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust. It is marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of pneumoconiosis. Silicosis (particularly the acute form) is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, fever, and cyanosis (bluish skin). It may often be misdiagnosed as pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pneumonia, or tuberculosis.
 Silicosis resulted in 46,000 deaths globall...</p>
