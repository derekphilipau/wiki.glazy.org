    <title>Giffin Grip fingers for trimming large platters</title>
    <link>https://wiki.glazy.org/t/giffin-grip-fingers-for-trimming-large-platters/679</link>
    <description>The fingers that I got with my Giffin Grip do not provide a way to trim large platters. I built these fingers from a little rod and some stiff foam. The foam is something I got in a package that was shipped to me. The white foam is not rigid but quite stiff and the blue layer you see is very stiff. I attached the rods to the foam simply by poking a whole in the foam and filling it with E6000 glue. I then shoved the rod in in the hole, not quite all the way to the other side.

The untrimmed platter you see is 19 inches in diameter. The fingers are set exactly as you see in the first picture, so this gadget will work for much larger platters.![DSC04361|539x640](upload://isDfeo3X1dzUcMbtmzvVtZ6JGAB.jpeg) ![DSC04363|564x640](upload://PLbTJfewYX1qf3hG7UaKhNIv21.jpeg) ![DSC04365|640x587](upload://yGIygm45HtCJzIJfq0GB26TZTNS.jpeg)</description>
