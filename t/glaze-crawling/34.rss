    <description>**What is Glaze Crawling?**

Taken from Digitalfire website, should be replaced:
&gt; Crawling is where the molten glaze withdraws into &#39;islands&#39; leaving bare clay patches. The edges of the islands are thickened and smoothly rounded. In moderate cases there are only a few bare patches of clay, in severe cases the glaze forms beads on the clay surface and drips off onto the shelf. The problem is by far most prevalent where bisque-applied glazes contain excessive plastic clay content or are applied thickly or in multiple layers. It is also common in once-fire ware where it is more difficult to achieve a good bond with the body surface.</description>
