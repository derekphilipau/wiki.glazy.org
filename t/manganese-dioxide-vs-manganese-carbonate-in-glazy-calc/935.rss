    <title>Manganese dioxide vs manganese carbonate in Glazy calc</title>
    <link>https://wiki.glazy.org/t/manganese-dioxide-vs-manganese-carbonate-in-glazy-calc/935</link>
    <description>I was looking at a bronze glaze by [Ruth Gillet #4576] (https://glazy.org/recipes/4576) and amending it to use the materials I have. When I substituted manganese dioxide for manganese carbonate the resulting MnO was treated completely differently [see #143794](https://glazy.org/recipes/143794). 

The carbonate in #4576 was included with R2 but the dioxide in #143794 is shown just as a colourant.  I referred to Digital Fire for the adjustment from carbonate to dioxide and altered all the other materials in #4576 before I changed the carbonate to dioxide [#143793](https://glazy.org/recipes/143793), so that I could make sure the glaze was in the same general area on Stull.  The glaze looked pretty similar until I changed the manganese and then it went off the Stull chart. Why are the two materials treated so very differently in the Stull analysis?</description>

            <p>Thanks very much Derek. Because there is a link to ceramicswiki I didn’t realise it was no longer active. And thanks for the INsta feedback. Julie</p>

            <p>Hi Julie, just saw your IG post and commented there.  This Wiki is defunct, you can now post questions and comments directly in Glazy by creating a New Post (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4u6yfGKcS0" class="inline-onebox">14. Posts - YouTube</a>) or adding a comment directly to a recipe or material.  I’ve made some updates to this wiki to make it more apparent that it is dead, but I don’t want to take down this wiki because there is still valuable info here.</p>
