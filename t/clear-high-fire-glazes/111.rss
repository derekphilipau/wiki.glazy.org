    <description>**The classic Leach 4321**

**Limestone Clear**
From John Britt&#39;s High-Fire Glazes book

https://glazy.org/recipes/2888

**Pete Pinnell&#39;s Clear**

https://glazy.org/recipes/338

**Nigel Wood&#39;s Porcelain Glaze**

From Nigel Wood&#39;s Chinese Glazes, page 263. Porcelain glaze, 1240-1290 degrees Celsius, oxidation or reduction.

This could also be classified as a Celadon, as the impurities in the kaolin and ball clay will lend it a bit of color. In my experience, changing the types of kaolin and ball clay used will significantly alter the appearance.
