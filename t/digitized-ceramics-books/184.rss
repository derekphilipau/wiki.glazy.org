            <p>There are several copies of Rhodes’ Clay and Glazes for the Potter on <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>. <a href="https://archive.org/details/clayandclazesfor006089mbp">This one</a> can be downloaded, but I’m not sure if it’s still under copyright. According to <a href="https://archive.org/post/135031/copyright-situation">this post</a>, it’s possible the copyright has expired, since it was published in 1957. If it’s still under copyright, we could link to <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=daniel%20rhodes%20potter">the others</a> on <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>.</p>
