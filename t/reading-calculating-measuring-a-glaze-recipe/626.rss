A glaze recipe is almost always listed as a “percentage or batch formula”, adding up to 100.  Every once in a while you’ll run across something that is slightly off (I was shown one adding up to 98.63% recently) -but that’s uncommon.

As stated in my post “[Getting Started with Crystalline Glazes](https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/2008/01/31/getting-started-with-crystalline-glazes/)“, when people ask me for a crystalline glaze recipe (^9-10), I offer them this to start with:

Frit 3110:  **50** %
Zinc Oxide:  **25** %
Silica:  **25** %

**50** + **25** + **25** = **100** %

The above would technically be referred to as a  *percentage formula* . If you wanted to make a small test, you’d probably just want to mix up 100 grams.
This would then be called a 100 gram  *batch formula* :

Frit 3110:  **50**  grams +
Zinc Oxide:  **25**  grams +
Silica:  **25**  grams
=  **100**  grams

Ok, so say you find that the glaze works, and you want to mix up 600 grams to test further…

Look at the above formula again, like this:

Frit 3110: 50 (x 1) =  **50**
Zinc Oxide: 25 (x 1) =  **25**
Silica: 25 (x 1) =  **25**
= **100** , right?

So for  **600**  grams:

Frit 3110: 50 (x 6) =  **300**  +
Zinc Oxide: 25 (x 6) =  **150**  +
Silica: 25 (x 6) =  **150**
=  **600**  grams

For  **800**  grams, multiply each part by  **8** ,
for  **950**  grams, multiply each part by  **9.5** ,
and for  **1000**  grams, multiply by  **10** .

In [John Britt](https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://www.johnbrittpottery.com/)’s book “Complete Guide to High Fire Glazes”, I list an  *Alkaline Base*  Recipe:

Frit 3110:  **51**
Calcined Zinc Oxide:  **23**
Silica:  **22**
Grolleg Kaolin:  **2.5**
Alumina Hydrate:  **1.5**
=  **100** %

The above formula is called a  *base glaze* . Base glazes typically come out clear or white. To this you can add colorants, modifiers, binders, etc. These are  *not*  usually listed as part of the formula, but you’d still multiply each one by the same number, to get an equal proportion in the glaze.
For  **750**  grams…
Frit 3110: 51 (x 7.5) =  **382.5**  grams
Calcined Zinc Oxide: 23 (x 7.5) =  **172.5**  grams
Silica: 22 (x 7.5) =  **165**  grams
Grolleg Kaolin: 2.5 (x 7.5) =  **18.75**  grams
Alumina Hydrate: 1.5 (x 7.5) =  **11.25**  grams

To get the dark blue glaze pictured on pg. 137 of Britt’s book, add:
Cobalt Oxide: 3 (x 7.5) =  **22.5**  grams
Manganese Dioxide: 3 (x 7.5) =  **22.5**  grams
Red Iron Oxide: 3 (x 7.5) =  **22.5**  grams
Bentonite (or CMC as a binder): 1 (x 7.5) =  **7.5**  grams

So you have  **750**  grams of the base +  **75**  grams of colorant and binder =  **825**  grams.
Now you can use that result to calculate [how much water to add](https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/2008/01/28/adding-water-suspendersbinders-to-a-glaze/).</description>
