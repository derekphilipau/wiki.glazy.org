## What is Pinholing?

&#39;Pinholes&#39; are small holes in the fired glaze surface possibly penetrating down to the body below. &#39;Pits&#39; are smaller, they mar the surface of the glaze. Pinholes or pits are often no larger than the head of a pin but can very in size. During the firing, air pockets are trapped in the melting process.These pockets form bubbles in the glaze that can swell until the break the surface.  The causes of pinholes is still understudy, and is not clearly defined. Work done by David Finklnburg (MS Thesis, Alfred University 2006) postulates that the air of negative space in an applied glaze (aka Pore Space Vapor) is the source of the bubbles/pinholes. As the air is trapped by the melting of the glaze, which forms into bubbles which can swell and pop as the glaze melts.

## Pinholes vs. Pits

David Finkelnburg: 
&gt; A pinhole is a glaze fault extending after firing from the clay body to the glaze surface. Any hole from the surface not reaching the body is simply a pit. Both may be caused by a gas bubble within the molten glaze bursting at the glaze surface. &quot;The cause...&quot; I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what I postulated, more like pore space CAN be a cause. I&#39;m pretty certain there&#39;s more than one cause. If pore space is a source, burnishing reduces pore spaces directly under the glaze. On the other hand, trimming a groggy body has the opposite effect, and in my observation seems to promote pinholes.

## Possible Solutions to Pinholing

**BURNISHING** 
Some have noted that burnishing the clay after trimming helps to reduce pinholing.  This burnishing can be done by simply sponging the pot on a wheel when dry, or sponging after trimming and then burnishing the pot.

----------
**TERRA SIGELLATA**
At low temperatures, cone 06 to perhaps cone 01 some potters dip trimmed areas in terra sigellata. This accomplishes two things. It partially seals the foot slowing moisture absorption, and it cuts down pinhole over the trimmed areas. Pinholes on lowfired ware are especially problematic in majolica glazes.


----------

**HIGHER BISQUE TEMP** 
It&#39;s suggested that bisque to a higher temperature in a clean oxidation atmosphere helps reduce pinholing.  The bisque temperature is recommended to be at least c06, possibly even higher to c04.  A short soak at the peak temperature may also help.  It is important that all combustibles in the clay body are fired out during the bisque period.  A hold at bisque temperature (approximately c06) during the glaze firing may also help.


----------

**GLAZE APPLICATION**

* When glazing the inside and outside at the same time, absorbed water displaces air in the porous bisque....this trapped air can form air bubbles that can form pinholes in glaze firing
One possible solution for this is to rinse and wipe the bisque, let it sit for an hour before glazing ....this leaves some water displacing air in the center of of the wall, thus leaving less air to be displaced and trapped when glazing the wall on both sides at the same time
* Rub down pin holes that are visible after you have applied the glaze, or fill in larger holes with watered-down glaze.

**From Matthew Katz** 

Lots of new things to share from my latest workshop at Sierra Nevada College. I&#39;ve been teaching for years that pin-holing is an application issue, and has nothing to do with gas release. This is all The same glaze. On porcelain one pinhole but on the first stoneware test, crazy pinholes. On the second stoneware test the tile was throughly dried after washing, before application. And the student admitted that they washed the test tile for the first sample, right before application. When applied to a dried tile, the pin-holing was radically reduced.

1 glaze, 2 bodies. The tiles on the right in both pics are the same tile, on stoneware. The left pic, left tile is a porcelain. The right pick left tile is the same stoneware as pin-holing sample. But the stoneware was washed and throughly dried, before application. The pin-holed tile was washed but not fully dried before application.

----------

**OVERFIRING CLAY** 
In some instances, over-firing a clay body may lead to pinholes.  Try firing to a slightly lower temperature to see if pinholes can be reduced, or switch clay bodies.


----------

**INCREASING GLAZE MELT** 
It has been suggested that pinholes are usually less prevalent on vertical surfaces vs. horizontal ones.  This is because the glaze is fluid enough to run down the side of the clay, healing over pinholes.  If you notice this to be the case, you can try to increase the glaze melt by adding more flux.


----------

**GLAZE FIRING SOAK**  
It is possible that a firing slower to peak temperature or holding at peak temperature during the glaze firing will help to heal over pinholes.  A 15 to 30 minute soak should help.

**Drop and soak**
After soaking on peak temp about 15-30 min. and then dropping temp. for about 40°C and soak again for about 30 min. can be very helpful in eliminating pinholes.

            <p>I realize this is probably not helpful and have no clue about your problem, however just now when looking for information about carbonates I came across this message from Pete Pinnell in Clayart.  I’m guessing you’re already using the fine ceramic grade version though…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were you, I would return that stuff to the supplier. There are many<br>
different grades of strontium carbonate available to them, and your<br>
supplier is stocking some rather poor stuff. A good, ceramic grade<br>
strontium carbonate should be a bright, fine, white powder that looks<br>
like a good grade of whiting and passes easily through a 60 mesh screen.<br>
If it doesn’t, send it back.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I often use strontium carbonate in glaze formulas, I get many<br>
inquiries from potters when their glazes don’t work. Inevitably, the<br>
problem turns out to be a coarse or impure grade of strontium. Just out<br>
of curiosity’s sake, I have tried ball milling some of the coarse, tan<br>
colored strontium that is sold, and it still didn’t work- which leads me<br>
to believe there must be other impurities involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides the difficulty in getting the stuff through a screen, there are<br>
a couple of other glaze flaws that seem to stem from this stuff,<br>
including pinholing, and excessive running. For instance, my Weathered<br>
Bronze glaze should not run at cone 9 reduction, and should not develop<br>
pinholes on a clean clay body, two problems I often see when others use<br>
it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I feel like that announcer at Woodstock: “Hey people, there’s<br>
some bad strontium out there!” (Am I showing my age with this arcane<br>
reference?)</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>I have a very sketchy idea of what happens on a microscopic level when a glaze melts, so my ideas may be completely off-base, but thought I’d raise the following questions anyway:</p>
<p>Is the volume of a particle of SrCO3 is greater than the volume of the resulting SrO particle(s) after it thermally decomposes? If it is, would this result in microscopic voids in the glaze, or would the particles just pack together more tightly?</p>
<p>Basically, I’d like to question the assumption that off-gassing of glaze materials can only be responsible for bubbles in the glaze if it happens after some of the glaze materials have started to melt. Can off-gassing change the particle-packing?</p>

            <p>I’m very curious about the results of this test. I’m convinced that strontium is contributing to bubbles in some way. I have worked this woo yellow glaze all over the stull map, fixed the flux ratio, added boron and the bubbles are still there. I’ve never removed the strontium though. Even if the pinholes don’t appear on the surface, if I break a tile, the bubbles are within the glaze. I have noticed a reduction in visible pinholes with the reduction of zircopax, but not necessarily an elimination. Seems that zircopax makes it worse.  And again, they only appear where the glaze is thick or pooling.</p>
<p>Another glaze we use at my studio is a strontium turquoise matte. It also pinholes sometimes and quite often produces small blisters on edges. Every glaze that I’ve wrestled with pinholes has contained strontium carb. If there was a strontium frit that I could get access to, I’d like to try that. My suppliers don’t carry any.</p>
<p>Here is the turquoise glaze on it’s own, over another glaze, and in reduction.  It’s always at the edges of the glaze and not always at the bottom, but sometimes on the rim. It does this on all 4 clay bodies we have at my studio - red stoneware, buff stoneware, white stoneware and porcelain.  But it doesn’t do it every time.  Sometimes it’s very smooth and lovely.</p>

<p>Here is the UMF of the Turquoise glaze.  It contains 2% Lith carb, which I know is a problem, but not sure if it’s contributing to this problem.  The woo yellow contains no Lith carb.  Colourant is 3% copper carb.</p>

            <p>Thanks Matt for the graph!<br>
I have European strontium carbonate from Colorobbia, CA is: SrO 70%, CO2 30%.<br>
A few days ago, after almost 20 years of struggling, I got CA from Colorobbia of some materials and frites!<br>
I have my opinion about glaze “sponge sindrom” based on observations of glazes through the chimney (and some common ceramic sense) when I had no pyrometer. But, for now:<br>
Altered glaze can prove that the problem is in strontium carbonate.<br>
If it has the same problems as original - the culprit is definitely just strontium carbonate.<br>
I will test both glaze with European materials and report the results.<br>
Cheers!</p>

            <p>Using David’s definition, is Sue’s glaze pinholing or pitting?  Looks like this doesn’t have to do with the clay body as much as bubbles in the thicker parts of the glaze?</p>

            <p>I appropriate your points, but those are not the relevant issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don’t hold this glaze against Sue, It is from John Britt’s mid temperature glaze book. Sue has just been using it to experiment with pinholes as the glazes has a history of pin holing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re not interested in altering the glaze’s chemistry, just defining why this exact glaze pinholes. That is why we would recreate the glaze with European materials. To see, if there is something in the American materials that causes the pin holing, or if the glaze recreated with European materials behaves exactly the same.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people proclaim that the pin holing here is caused by the degassing of the Strontium Carbonate.</p>
<p>But this chart, shows that SrCO3 degassed long before the glassy stage of the firing, making that an impossibility. So the relevant question is, Is there something in Strontium Carb that influences particle packing and thus, pinholing.</p>

            <p>About culprits in Sue’s glaze… The glaze has very high LOI. We can do nothing about strontium carb, but by simply replacing dolomite with talc and wollastonite we can significantly reduce LOI.<br>
I do not have a small test kiln (after summer I’ll make one), so at the next cone 6 firing, I’ll try both these glaze with soaking at 40 °C below the peak and I’ll document everything.</p>
<p>P.S. I do not like the chemistry of this glaze, but it’s not for this thread</p>

            <p>yeah, a lot of these firing tips are based on individual experience, mine included.</p>
<p>i have strong doubts about the “oxidation hold of 15-30 minutes” after reduction to reduce pinholes and “even out the glaze”, i’m not claiming that it doesn’t work but my own experience points to other solutions.  i’d like to see proof.</p>

            <p>After soaking on peak temp about 15-30 min. and then dropping temp. for about 40°C and soak again for about 30 min. can be very helpful in eliminating pinholes.</p>

            <p>Its not about order per se. It is about flooding the bisque pores. When you glaze one side, you can possibly flood the pores with water. Which means that when you apply to the other side, the quality of packing is effected, which can lead to pinholes.</p>

            <p>This might be a good place to clarify or fact check on if Light Rutile is Calcined Rutile and Dark Rutile is uncalcined Rutile.</p>

            <p>Somewhere in a thread in Ceramic Recipes, Peter recommended either first glazing the inside, then outside, or vice versa.  But I don’t think he mentioned why?  What is the best order and why?</p>

            <p>Luckily were here</p>
<p>Although this brings up a greater subject that we have danced around in glazy. We need some sort of collaborative test design and documentation system.</p>

            <p>I think both Matt and Peter Berg recommended:  Slightly deflocculating the glaze.  Also wetting the ware before application (or finding some other way to slow the glaze drying).  And perhaps replacing carbonates like whiting with Wollastonite?  I wish I could go through all of their Facebook posts and put everything together.</p>

            <p>I’m willing to explore the particle packing theory, but how do we apprach it, other than ball milling the mix?</p>

            <p>This is why I’m very confident about the cause, being the packing or the particles in the raw glaze.</p>
