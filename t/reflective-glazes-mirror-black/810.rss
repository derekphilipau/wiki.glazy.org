    <title>Reflective Glazes: Mirror Black</title>
    <link>https://wiki.glazy.org/t/reflective-glazes-mirror-black/810</link>
    <description>Mirror Black recipe is found to be have the best reflective properties as the recipe is found on [Glazy](https://glazy.org/recipes/11043). After altering many different aspects of the recipe the original seems to work the best for what I was using it for in reflecting neon tube lighting. It has great reactions on non-flat surfaces in altering the light. Applied by dipping or brush strokes did not seem to affect the effect by much as long as it is applied thick either way. When thin, Mirror Black it not reflective and is a brown color.</description>
