    <title>Glazy (and version 2)</title>
    <link>https://wiki.glazy.org/t/glazy-and-version-2/30</link>
    <description>Glazy was built using the latest open source tools, including Laravel and Bootstrap.

The Glazy database of ceramic recipes was seeded with data from Linda Arbuckle&#39;s GlazeChem database, John Sankey&#39;s glaze database, and Louis Katz&#39;s Hyperglaze database. John Britt, Alisa Liskin Clausen, Terry Rorison and Tara Hagen have also included their glaze tests with images.

Glazy is in continuous development, guided by technical input from a number of potters around the world. In particular, Pieter Mostert and Matt Katz have provided invaluable insights and suggestions.</description>
