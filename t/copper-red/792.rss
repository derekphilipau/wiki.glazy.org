# Firing Schedules

&gt; Hi David, 
&gt; From my experience, a slow cooling actually helps copper reds, making 
&gt; them deeper and more transparent. The huge kilns that the Chinese used 
&gt; to produce copper reds during the Ching Dynasty took WEEKS to cool, not 
&gt; days. 
&gt; I would guess that the reason you&#39;re not getting red is that either you 
&gt; are not beginning your reduction soon enough, or there is too thin a 
&gt; glaze application. Either of these can result in the result you described. 
&gt; Firing and application requirements vary depending on the formula of the 
&gt; glaze, but generally I would say that reduction should begin by about 
&gt; Orton cone 012. This is quite a bit earlier than is required by most 
&gt; glazes, but that is because these high alkalie, low alumina formulas 
&gt; begin to flux at a much earlier point.Once these glazes melt, they are 
&gt; hard to reduce. The spaces in the glaze matrix are just too small for 
&gt; the reduction molecules to penetrate, kind of like trying to push 
&gt; basketballs through a screen door. 
&gt; During the firing, a copper red separates into several distinct layers. 
&gt; Between the body and the glaze a layer of anorthite and wollastonite 
&gt; crystals grow that provide a white backround for the glaze. Above that 
&gt; is a red layer that is made up of a liquid/liquid phase seperation: 
&gt; globules of red glass floating in a transparent glaze. Above it all is a 
&gt; thin, clear layer. If the glaze is applied too thinly, the first layer to 
&gt; go is the red one. It is possible to produce even more layers by adding 
&gt; a small amount of zinc, which adds tiny orange flects, and titania, which 
&gt; pushes the glaze towards blue. 
&gt; Are you using the same kind of burners that you used before? Are you 
&gt; measuring reduction? It could just be that you are not getting as much 
&gt; reduction as you think. 
&gt; Good luck.

&gt; P.S. I had the best luck with copper carbonate, in a ration of one to 
&gt; three with tin oxide. ( .33 % copper carb to 1.0% tin oxide)

&gt; Pete Pinnell gave an excellent workshop at ClayFactory in Tampa several 
&gt; years back, and fired a bunch of copper reds at U to Tampa. He 
&gt; demonstrated that his method of early reduction (beginning at cone 010), 
&gt; then neutral up to almost temperature followed by at least 20 minutes of 
&gt; oxidizing produces beautiful copper reds. What I was taught to do, a 
&gt; &quot;glaze reduction&quot; at cone 9 or 10, didn&#39;t matter and just wasted fuel. 
&gt;
&gt; At UF we have a small gas test kiln, so that I could try this at home 
&gt; cautiously and see if I could get the same results as a &quot;trained 
&gt; professional&quot; in copper reds. Worked fine. As Pete pointed out, thick 
&gt; enough glaze application and a good glaze are also needed, but not a 
&gt; second reduction.
