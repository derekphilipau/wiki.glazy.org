    <title>Flue sizing</title>
    <link>https://wiki.glazy.org/t/flue-sizing/928</link>
    <description>I have access to a wood fired soda kiln, based on Peg Udall&#39;s design. We&#39;ve fired several times and have trouble getting temp *10 on top.  It was built with what appear to be very large flue openings.  Is there any formula, rule of thumb for the size of flue opening?</description>
