          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This Discourse Wiki was an attempt to provide a home for Glazy’s documentation as well as support and discussion related to glaze chemistry.  Unfortunately it didn’t work out.</p>
<p>You can now have discussions directly in Glazy, just go to <a href="https://glazy.org/">https://glazy.org/</a> and create a new Post.</p>

          <title>Manganese dioxide vs manganese carbonate in Glazy calc</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was looking at a bronze glaze by [Ruth Gillet <span class="hashtag">#4576</span>] (<a href="https://glazy.org/recipes/4576" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Glazy</a>) and amending it to use the materials I have. When I substituted manganese dioxide for manganese carbonate the resulting MnO was treated completely differently <a href="https://glazy.org/recipes/143794" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">see #143794</a>.</p>
<p>The carbonate in <span class="hashtag">#4576</span> was included with R2 but the dioxide in <span class="hashtag">#143794</span> is shown just as a colourant.  I referred to Digital Fire for the adjustment from carbonate to dioxide and altered all the other materials in <span class="hashtag">#4576</span> before I changed the carbonate to dioxide <a href="https://glazy.org/recipes/143793" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">#143793</a>, so that I could make sure the glaze was in the same general area on Stull.  The glaze looked pretty similar until I changed the manganese and then it went off the Stull chart. Why are the two materials treated so very differently in the Stull analysis?</p>

            <p>I have access to a wood fired soda kiln, based on Peg Udall’s design. We’ve fired several times and have trouble getting temp *10 on top.  It was built with what appear to be very large flue openings.  Is there any formula, rule of thumb for the size of flue opening?</p>

            <p><em>Fen Wang∗, Changan Yang, Jianfeng Zhu, and Ying Lin Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710021, China</em></p>
<p>Based on the traditional Jun ware glaze, the imitated Jun ware glazes were prepared by adding iron oxide and introducing phase separation agent apatite through four-angle-method. The effect of iron oxide contents, phase separation and the firing temperature on the color of Jun ware glazes were investigated by a neutral atmosphere experiment, optical microscope and scanning electronic microscope. The results showed that the colorant, mainly Fe2O3, contributed to the Jun ware glaze blue and cyan colors of Jun ware glaze. The light scatter caused by the small droplets in phase separation structure only influenced the shade of the glaze color, intensify or weaken the color, and thus made the glaze perfect and elegant opal visual effects, but was not the origin of general blue or cyan colors of Jun ware glaze. In addition, the firing temperature and the basic glaze composition affected the glaze colors to some extent.</p>

<p>Science for Potters, by Linda Bloomfield, covers those aspects of science that are useful to potters and that help to give a deeper understanding of ceramic materials and processes. By gaining a deeper understanding of materials, their structure, composition, origins, and how they interact, potters can have greater control over and new insights into their craft.</p>
<p>Many people think that science is a subject that is at the opposite end of the spectrum from art. But ceramic artists know that ceramics IS science as much as it is art. Trouble is, science is a subject that doesn’t come easily for some. That’s why Linda Bloomfield, who was trained as a scientist before becoming a potter, wrote  <em>Science for Potters</em> .</p>
<h3>You’ll learn about:</h3>
<ul>
<li>the basics of chemistry in clear and simple terms</li>
<li>how the chemistry and structure of clay bodies affects their working properties</li>
<li>what makes a stable glaze</li>
<li>how materials interact in a glaze</li>
<li>glaze faults and how to correct them</li>
<li>substitutions for glaze materials that are no longer available</li>
<li>the glaze unity molecular formula and why it’s so important</li>
</ul>
<h3>The basics and beyond!</h3>
<p>Beginning with the basics, Linda covers the structure of the atom, how atoms combine to make compounds, and why some compounds can be used to make colored pigments and glazes. You’ll discover how things like the Moh’s Scale of Hardness can help you formulate scratch-resistant glazes or how the Periodic Table of the Elements pertains specifically to ceramics.</p>
<h3>Geology and the potter!</h3>
<p>Linda focuses on the aspects of geology, chemistry, and materials science that are relevant to potters. The properties of clays are explained by examining their chemistry and structure, and the various rocks and minerals used in glaze making are explored. By understanding how the structure of different clays affects their working properties, potters can select clays appropriate to the forming and firing methods they choose to use.</p>
<h3>Glazing and Firing</h3>
<p>Making sure your glaze fits your clay body is something that cannot be ignored by the potter, and a chapter is dedicated to glaze fit. Within that chapter, Bloomfield explains glaze faults and how to correct the. She also includes an exceptionally clear explanation of the changes that clay goes through during firing to become ceramic. The deeper understanding of materials, their structure, composition, origins, and how they interact will give potters greater control over and new insights into their craft.</p>
<h3>Appendixes</h3>
<p>Useful appendixes include a glossary, ceramic materials list, Orton Cone Chart, Phase Diagram for Silica-Almina-Calcia, materials analysis charts for both US and UK frits, clays and feldspars, a complete Periodic Table of the Elements and an index.</p>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Linda Bloomfield was born in Ithaca, New York. She grew up in England and studied engineering at Warwick University, with a year at MIT during her PhD studies. She spent a year in Tsukuba, Japan, working for NEC (Nippon Electric Company), then returned to London to work as a researcher at Imperial College. She started her pottery career while living in California, where she became familiar with US potters’ materials. She now lives in London where she makes porcelain tableware, teaches glaze courses, and writes pottery books.</p>

            <p>Hi, been watching John Britt’s nice new series of videos and am ready to start actually USING Glazy-- and side note, THANK YOU Derek, et al. for Glazy!!<br>
Problem-- I see how to allow “pinch &amp; zoom” for touchscreens(phone.)<br>
However the Stull charts when using my computer are way too small for me to see. Zooming my computer screen helps only a little. It’s especially bad when using pictures on the chart.<br>
Question-- Is there a way to ZOOM ON THE STULL CHART ON A PC?<br>
Hopefully I’m just being a bonehead &amp; overlooking something simple &amp; obvious.<br>
Cheers.</p>

          <title>Traditional Celadons</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[chenyu_lu]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Glaze Types</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Chinese celadon</p>
<p>Primitive celadons had been discovered all over China but concentrated in Zhejiang province. The earliest examples can be dated to the 3rd century B.C. in the late Zhou period. Similar vessels have also been found in Han tombs. They often resemble ritual bronze vessels, and the glazes tend to be uneven, imperfectly fired and brownish yellow in color.</p>
<p>The Yue wares were first produced in the Eastern Han period (1st – 3rd c.) in Hangzhou. In these earliest wares the body is a light grey between stoneware and porcelain, and the glaze varies from light olive to green. Yue ware developed further until it reached its peak from the Tang dynasty to Song dynasty. Mise (secret/forbidden color) ware is a variety of Yue ware first made for royal use in the Wuyue Kingdom (10th c.) of the Five Dynasties period, which is highly vitreous and renowned for their clear colors. Generally, glazes in this period transitioned from grey and olive to mostly green, and carved decoratioons depict a range of motifs from animal, floral to Buddhist. In the Tang dynasty Yue wares were a staple export, and fragments have been found in places as far as the Persian Gulf. Yue wares were found in temples and tombs in Japan and Korea, and arrival of Yue potters is likely to have helped the development of Koryu celadon in the 11th century.</p>
<p>Ru wares were produced in northern China, specifically commissioned for the imperial court in the Song dynasty (10-13th c.), and were considered the first among the “Five Great Kilns” in that period. Ru wares have simple, sometimes angular shapes. Some were left plain, and others decorated with elaborated carving of floral or animal motifs. The wares tend to be fully glazed and fired with tiny “sesame” stilts. The glaze is applied in several layers and differ in color, from green to sky blue to extremely pale blue. In order to imitate the appearance of jade, a thick texture “like lard dissolving” is desired. Ru wares were and stay very rare, since they were only in production for several decades at the end of the 11th century or start of the 12th century. The scarcity prompted attempts to reproduce these extremely valuable wares. They were imitated in Korean shortly after initial production, and Yongzheng Emperor (1723-35) of the Qing dynasty ordered potters in Jindezhen to copy Ru pieces from the imperial collection. For long the copies have been confused with the originals.</p>
<p>The Guan (official) kilns were established in Hangzhou under direction of the Song court after they fled from northern invasion and lost access to the Ru and Jun kilns. Production is likely to have started after peace was largely restored in 1141. Guan ware has thin (1-3mm) body and thick (0.5-2.5mm) glaze applied in several layers, and the glaze can become thicker than the body. Since they are reduction fired, the bodies appear rather dark for their iron content (3-5%). Crackled glaze is common in Guan wares, which could be unintentional or deliberate, but regardless became highly desired later and frequently imitated. The best wares have wide crackles on greyish blue glaze, followed by those with denser crackles and in brown, green, or gray. Crackling is due to the glazes contracting more than the bodies in the process of cooling, and the low silica level in Guan wares contributes to their crackles. The multiple layers of glaze can develop independent crazing systems, enhancing the depth of the glaze. The wares were often stained to emphasize the crackles, though they also become darker through use or burial.</p>
<p>Longquan ware was produced from late Song to the Yuan and Ming and in such large volume that it eclipsed earlier celadon for a long time. These mass produced wares tend to be in simple shapes, sometimes with carved or molded decorations that are less elaborate than earlier examples. Their more austere aesthetics seems to reflect the new idea about classical refinement at the Song court. The clay has high iron content, and exposed clay turn red brown in the cooling process when fresh air is let in after reduction firing, turning the iron into red iron oxide. The level of standardization is high, though the color of the glaze varies from blue, jade green to olive and gray. In earlier wares the presence of air bubbles and unmelted particles create a softly glowing effect, and later wares in the Ming dynasty are transparent due to higher firing temperature. The first layer of glaze is applied before the bisque firing, and more layers are applied and refired to a high temperature (1230-1290°C). Longquan ware was exported along all trade routes in central, southern and south-east Asia, and along the African east coast. They were exported in large numbers to Japan, and several Japanese classifying terms like kinuta (pale bluish green wares), tenryuji (pea green wares), and shichikan (clear water green wares) became widely used. Towards the end of the Song period, the high demand made it difficult to maintain high production standards. Wares became larger and thicker, which helped surviving long distance trade routes. The peak of exports was reached in the Ming dynasty, before production declined due to competition from blue and white wares in Jingdezhen.</p>
<p>Korean celadon</p>
<p>Traditional Korean celadon was first produced and peaked in Koryu dynasty. Though high-fire green and brown stoneware was already being produced, the earliest “true” celadon wares were made in the end of 10th century AD. The close connection between Koryu wares and Chinese wares is apparent from the presence of Song wares in Koryo tombs. Yue wares produced in Zhejiang are likely to be a direct influence, as is shown by records of exchange of objects and potters between the regions. In early 12th century, Koryu ware saw a golden age marked by development of an original style, significant improvement in technique, and introduction of inlaying. Chinese forms and styles were adjusted to fit Korean taste, and inlaid wares became a central style. This prosperity continued into the first quarter of 13th century, and the decline in quality began before the Mongol invasion in 1231, which halted production completely. After work resumed in late 13th century, quality dipped further due to the impact of the war and Mongol occupancy. After the fall of Koryu dynasty in the end of 14th century, manufacturing technique for celadon was lost until it was rediscovered in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Glazes in Koryu celadon tend to resemble those in Longquan celadons. Due to imperfections in technique, they tend to be more varied in color, ranging from olive, green, to blue. Other features include a purple tint caused by the iron content in glaze or body, and brownish discoloration caused by accidental oxidation when the reducing atmosphere wasn’t maintained. Koryu potters used these properties to accentuate their designs, as the discoloration and running often produced a shading effect in vessels with relief, carved, or molded decoration.</p>

          <title>American Raku</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Chenxi_Wang]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA)</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Whether the Asian style technology could be used in other cultures is debatable, yet Japanese raku was reborn and infused in American by Paul Souldner under the western social environment. Although the process of raku in America was affected by a lot of the original Japanese-style raku technology, it still matched with the American spirit and attitude on their life in this age. Eventually, it turned from a conventional craft-making technology to an exotic but also “native” contemporary art form by American culture, society and history.</p>
<p>The technology raku was first invented in 16th century Japan, and its character originally came from the Chinese seal glaze. As one of the most traditional Japanese ceramic firing methods, it was invented by Sen no Rikyūa about 16th century. In conventional Japanese process, it results from the low firing and lead glazes and the removal of pieces from the portable kiln glowing hot. American raku begins from fifty-nine years ago in 1960s, and Paul Soldner, the name has been related with it for a long time. Except him, there are few American potters made in Japanese ruku style before 1960.</p>
<p>Warren Gilbertson, who had studied raku in Japan, presented an exhibition of his work at the Chicago Art Institute in the 1940s. If there would be a man we have to talk about in American raku, that should be him. After the first show exhibited in chicago, it was the first time for American to see this fabulous ceramic work, though he almost imitated the Japanese style tea bowls. This Asian tendency of pottery making has lasted for about 10 years. That was the early history of American raku initiated to be utilized and reached out the art stage in USA.</p>
<p>American raku started off from fifty-nine years ago. With the progress of this firing method processing for more than half a century in America, it is even more prevalent and acceptable that this originally local firing method has been reborn by a typical American style back to the early 1960s in California . Certainly, they both overlap and own several similarities between each other. However, the varied techniques American-style-raku are somewhat disguised with the ancient process in Japan for centuries.</p>
<p>However, it has been a long time that there was still a hard time cataloguing and debating between the Japanese-style raku and American one, though there are truly some distinctions between them. Such as the name of American raku, not only the local Japanese raku organization debated that the name “raku” literally belongs with their own family technology style, but also even the official American artistic organization got some heated arguments about naming this innovative technology. Thus, it is vital to dig out the exploration how American social history shaped a typical Asian technology, then infused a brand new soul into this technique.</p>
<p>Japanese local raku firing has been processing since the 15th century till now. The successive generations of the Raku family are still inheriting and maintaining this ancient ceramic-making technology for more than 400 hundred years. Raku family could be traced back to Tanaka Sokei (born c.1535). Inspired by Chinese tenmoku glaze, the birth of raku wares could be dated back to Raku tea bowls made up by Chojiro. It took some time for Chojiro’s tea bowls to reply to the wabi tea aesthetic style. In contrast to the typical Chinese teaware and early Japanese tea bowls thrown on the wheel, like bowls made in Mino kiln, Chojiro’s Raku wares were hand formed instead. Raku ware started to achieve the ideas from local wabi-cha aesthetic, referring to the early Japanese philosophical expression. Wabi-cha can be defined as a conceptual and philosophical revolution that impacted on various Japanese local lifestyle. The birth of Raku wares represented the cultural flow, and reached out the essence of the Japanese spirit of Wabi-Sabi, by the evolution of their aesthetic construction. From where I stand, the beginning of raku wares in Japan could not be described as a start of technology. Since the appearance of raku firing is nothing about industrialization and productive of a technology, but focuses on attaching with the core of the spiritual thinking inside Japanese society and culture. In other words, the Japanese philosophical system infused and presented on Japanese artistic aesthetic and concept.</p>
<p>So it is coherent that Japanese raku family could not accept the new raku innovation taking place in America as an individual artistic form in the1960s. Raku totally worked as another cultural representation instead of traditional Japanese philosophy. Raku is not only a craft-making technology, but also one of the symbolic representations about Japanese social culture. Even according to the afterwards conventional raku maker Raku Kichizaemon XV and Raku Atsundo’s self introduction about raku making in this age, he still considers American raku as an exploration that was from tradition instead of individual art form which can not be compared with Japanese raku wares. (Figure1)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the start of American raku technology is not only an exploration from convention. American raku is more than innovation about technology, to the contemporary ceramic arts.( Figure2 ). There is a fundamental distinction between the way of inheriting tradition in the west and a so-called academic flow, in ancient Asia, especially in Japan. The American raku tradition commenced about 59 years ago. Warren Gibetson was the first person who has studied Japanese Raku there, to propose a great show at the Chicago Art Institute in the 1940s, which is considered as the first inspiration about American raku. That was also him who posted an article about raku on the magazine Bulletin of Ameican ceramic society in 1943 to explore this original Asian art around the US. And another rakuwares pioneer, Hal Riegger started to experience with raku firing in the 1940s. He tried to create more universal expressive raku works instead of maintaining the ancient convention from Japanese raku. However, it is kind of ridiculous that eventually Riegger argued the raku stands at the opposite to western philosophical system. Afterwards, some of typical Japanese raku makers still agree with that. Both the early American raku makers has experienced fantastic firing process as the most experimental ceramic pioneers have. As Jennifer Harnetty observed and posted in Ceramics art daily, it says that “I think raku firing intrigues many a potter because of the drama involved in the process. How is it to take out a red-hot piece out of the kiln, see the molten glaze and hear the pings from the thermal shock. And there’s the flame.” It is not ridiculous that the most first inspired american raku makers came out with more freedom and creativity rather than the restriction from the Asian origins. Drama, absurd, and fantasy were the inspiration derived from the artistic Japanese raku ceramics in the 1940s, and also overlaps between the two genres.</p>
<p>However, according to the American ceramic history, it is misconceptual now that the early raku makers separated the tradition and universal creativity. There is no doubt that the explorer started a brand new ceramic technique in the US. But the improvement from Paul Solder intrigues more American potters embrace into this incredible technique. It was through his contribution that raku could be colonized and grafted on the ceramic studio art cross the country. It is Soldner who proposed to point out the distinguishment between American and Japanese raku.</p>
<p>Souldner’s experience about the raku firing process breakthrough some frontiers of the on the original Japanese custom. It’s such a typical American-style change inside the raku revolution. Referring to the copy of Leche’s book a potter’s book, he started to present new ideas about the conventional procedures. Based on the Japanese habits, he totally innovated about the cool-down step which was used to firing slowly and then cooled slowly. “I think Raku warranted a try.” He explained in his own academic reports about American raku. He took a risk quenching the hot-red vessel in cold water to cool down immediately. Besides, he created one more step for raku making to smoke the surface and play with the glaze with the diverse materials, like copper slip. It is not astonishing that he gave up the restrictive raku expression like tea-bowl wares, and academic raku making process, since there was no tea ceremony in western culture that would reply to Japanese traditional significance. With more Souldner’s experience with various technical creation based on the genuine Japanese raku, American raku appeared on the global craft and art stage as a new contemporary art form. In short, Soldier’s revolution on raku presented his revolt and enthusiasm, which exactly reflects the hidden influence by American main current of culture and art in the 1960s.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and early 1970s, after World War II, the modern dream of a world that hoped for a painless trouble reached its peak, and it was the most beautiful dream floating across American society, especially in the west coast. Hippies, suffers, and neoliberalism; they represented the group of the American society which tried to stand against the mainstream culture and challenge the restrictive political tradition and stationary social discipline. During the decade, they oppose war, resisted haircuts, invente new art forms under the influence of LSD, and imagine a future that will transcend Western symbols. Art and life are an integral part of it. The society started to discuss the Panthers, Chicanos and feminists. It is the announcement that called up the Equal Rights. There were full of imagination, freedom, breakthroughs and revolts in American fantastic 60s. Relying on self-publication, their new typical American viewpoints about their life and art later spread around the US.</p>
<p>All the insurgency in the 1960s suggests all the great art revolution took place at the beginning of the 20th century, like the modernist movement. They established the foundation of the contemporary art stage. Also, it was a reconstruction about the cultural trends and the philosophical system in the western society. People following Modernism movement rejected the innate religious belief, the ritual convention, and certainty of enlightenment thinking. The contemporaneity of their work lies in how they initiated breaks with the past and explored the expansive possibilities of what art can be.</p>
<p>Under the progress of modernism, the invisible power of conceptualization reshaped the awareness of the entire society. Like the argument from Kaja Kraner, it says “We could say that modernist art tries to achieve sensual independence (of men) through the medium of sensual (experience): a sensual supersensual (if we borrow from Marx’s reflection on commodity fetishism).” For instance, after the first show of fountain by Duchamp in 1917, the experimental art and concept inspired the whole art world to think about the relationship between the artist, audience and society in the west. Afterwards, all the artistic doctrine are followed with Duchamp’s Dadaism. Like expressionism, and abstractionism etc, they did not only impact the original western art system, but also stroke and diverse the social consciousness in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>With the advancement of modernism and colonization of experimental art in 20 century, the influence of social awareness and cultural trends also spurred the conceptualization in the ceramic field. Peter Vouklos, who was called as the father of American modern ceramic art, was the first person to invite modernism into American ceramic making. He was famous for his abstract expressionism ceramic sculpture which combine the fine art and ceramic craft. In ceramics, his creation and concept were always analogise with Jackson pollock，who represnted the major American figure in abstract expressionism movement. Conceptualization in ceramic making activate ceramicists’ creativity. Artists and ceramicists started to consider ceramics as a contemporary art form. It could be an artistic medium to express artists’ personal perspectives.</p>
<p>This revolution of art never happened voluntarily in asian countries, though it truly influenced the asian contemporary art system in this age. Conventionally, Japanese ceramic makers still believe the pride of purity and authority in raku wares which embraces their ritual respects and daily philosophy. Thus, it is reasonable to hear from Raku Kichizaemon XV generation of raku family to say, “American ceramic makers are more into technology of Raku firing rather than the real aesthetic from profound Japanese aesthetic.” On account of the distinction between the cultural trends and philosophical understanding inside the public society, the orthodoxy of raku drives from two original cultural environment.</p>
<p>This could be the appropriate reason why the modern art movement started in New York, but Kyoto or Tokyo.</p>
<p>Certainly, Paul Soldner’s creativity is one of the most straightforward reasons to change raku. But it is not avoidable to discuss the revolution of raku wares without the support of different countries’ cultural environment and social consciousness. After being drafted into the Army and serving as a medic for three-and-a-half years during World War II, he returned to the United States with a strong interest in art, and the desire to pursue a more artistic career. He earned a bachelor’s degree in Art Education at Bluffton College in Ohio, and then a master’s degree in Arts Administration from the University of Colorado in Boulder Under the mainstream hippies and neoliberalism, it is not hard to speculate that Soldner was exactly affected by this fresh wave of now thinking, especially in the art institution.</p>
<p>At the age of 33, Soldner decided to become a potter. He headed for the Los Angeles County Art Institute, and became Peter Voulkos’s first student, earning a M.F.A. in 1956.after the education with Peter Vouklos, sodlner’s ceramic works emphasized his own concepts and personal expression by raku firing works. They were transcended from ancient craft technique to a contemporary art form worked for ceramic art studio.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>To a certain extent, American style raku are based on Japanese traditional craft making technology and changed under its own cultural trends and art movement associated with public social awareness and appreciation. The specific technological comparison between American and Japanese raku just evidence superficially the distinguishment about the exact steps. However, it is the social consciousness that decides essentially the reasons why American-style raku innovated and was reborn in the 1960s in the US again. Paul Soldner is not only contributive, meaningful and essential to the entire American ceramic art, but also he was just the shiny representation of the American social culture at that time.</p>

<p>Raku Firing</p>
<p>Raku is a very complicated and fascinating version of firing ceramics. Simply put, it is the method of removing bisque-fired ceramics from a kiln without letting them cool down and then moving them into some type of closed container with some material within it that will create a flammable atmosphere. The results vary widely, and will change from a variety of factors. Some of them are the amount of time it takes to move the piece from the raku kiln to the enclosed container, how long the piece sits in the enclosed container, the thickness of the glaze that is put on the piece, and the type of raku kiln being used. The results are a lot less reliable than traditional kiln firing, which makes the pieces much more unique. The history of raku firing, the many nuances in the processes and results, and the uniqueness of these pots are all facets of what makes raku firing such an interesting method of creating.</p>
<p>The history of raku firing is very long, and instances of it can be seen in different parts of the world. It was originally invented in 16thcentury Japan, in a province called Kyoto. The original raku pottery pieces were used in tea ceremonies and were considered to be extremely valuable, and they had an immense amount of meaning behind them. These traditional pots were used as Ceremonial Tea Ware of the Zen Buddhist Masters, and the word Raku signified enjoyment of freedom. The raku tea ceremony bowls incorporated Zen principles such as harmony, reverence, purity, and tranquility and both the process and specific results in their tea bowls incorporated an avoidance of luxury and a natural aesthetic that was greatly valued at the time and in their culture. These specific bowls were hand built, and the results from this artistic and spiritual process fit in with the Zen philosophy of Buddhism that inspired the invention of this amazing process. (Lavey.) The fact that these bowls were valued for their imperfections and asymmetry rather than those aspects being flaws is something that can be greatly admired about both the Zen philosophies that inspired these pots and the 16thcentury artists who continue to give inspiration to modern potters.</p>
<p>“According to the Zen Masters, its elusive, subtle, yet vigorous beauty is Raku’s only worth. It is valued because it is believed that the Spirit of the Maker is embodied in the form and revealed at the foot, which is traditionally left naked (unglazed). It is believed that if we are alert to ourselves, in contemplating the Raku form, we will recognize in it our own Spirit and Meaning. (Lavey.)”</p>
<p>This is the very beautiful and culturally rich origin of raku firing, and it has gone on to inspire ceramic artists all over the world for centuries to come. Artists often create to recognize their own personal meanings and embody some part of themselves into their preferred forms and methods of process, and around the world artists found different ways to preform raku firing and it reflected on their cultures just like it did from its origins. Raku firing can be a very personal and even spiritual experience, due to it being much more hands-on experience compared to other firing methods and the nature of the process and results.</p>
<p>The process of raku firing can vary from the traditional method of the pieces being removed from the kiln and then cooled at air temperature, to the most common contemporary method of removing the kiln before any cooling at all and moved into an airtight container with flammable material put inside of it beforehand which is commonly known as the more “Western” version. The flammable materials are most commonly sawdust or newspaper. This process starves the pot of oxygen, and the glazes react to this in very beautiful ways. The pots themselves are most often made from a stoneware clay, which tends to be a lighter color both in unfired and fired forms. The unglazed portions of the pots turn black through this firing process, due to the pot being starved from oxygen in this Western version where they are put into the airtight container. The container often is a metal trash can, but anything that is airtight and can safely contain the flammable materials will give the desired result of a reduction chamber that deprives the pot of oxygen which greatly influences the result of the finish, no matter what the glaze is. The lid has to be put on the airtight container very quickly to assure that the oxygen reduction happens at an ideal rate, and the amount of time taken to move the pot to whatever container it reduces in will affect the finish greatly. After the pot has cooled down, it is often cleaned because whatever the combustible material inside the reduction chamber usually leaves soot over the piece.</p>
<p>Due to this reduction process being somewhat aggressive and exposes the pieces to a great amount of shock, there is a relatively high rate of cracking or exploding. Another factor that can add to the higher likelihood of damage is the fact that the pot is moved during the firing, and has to be moved very quickly. In traditional firing methods, this is not an element that has to be considered since the pots sit in one place throughout the entire firing process.</p>
<p>Raku is a comparatively low-fire method compared to other traditional methods such as high-fire oxidation or reduction firings. Western raku is typically heated to around 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit which falls into the category of cone 06 which is considered low-fire. High-fire can go up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. Another difference is that traditional firing cycles can take up to 10 hours, with additional time added for the time it takes for the kiln to heat up and cool down enough to be able to take the ceramics out of the kiln safely. The pots must be taken out using tongs, gloves, and sometimes even a full protective outfit due to the risks of being burned. With raku firing, the firing cycle is very short: around 15 minutes to 1 hour in the kiln which is very unique for kiln firings.</p>
<p>The time spent after taking raku fired pots out of the kiln depends on whether it is done with the Eastern method or the Western method. The Eastern method often incorporates rapid cooling of the newly removed and still red-hot fired pieces in normal air temperatures or dipped or sprayed with water. The Western method is the one previously described where the pieces go through a post-firing reduction by being places in an enclosed container and starved of oxygen. (D’Souza.)</p>
<p>Another aspect of the raku process is that the kiln is heated much more quickly compared to other kiln firings, and this shock of heat combined with the shock of air temperature result in the unique appearance of raku pots having a heavily crazed or glossy surface. Whether or not the firing is done in the method where it is placed in the airtight enclosed container after being removed from the raku kiln, this shock of being taken out of the kiln still affects the pot. This process creates for a very unpredictable outcome which is one of the aspects that makes it so appealing to many potters.</p>
<p>Some of the more common contemporary raku finishes are a matte multi-colored finish, a high shine muti-colored finish, a white crackle finish, or the very interesting method of burned hair or feather finishes. Most glazes are suitable for raku firings, but there are specific glazes made for raku firings that take into account all of the different variables of the firing so they can produce more ideal results. Raku pots are usually not food safe, due to the risk of flaking on the pots and the nature of the resulting glaze finishes and they are also less durable than traditionally fired stoneware pieces due to being in the kiln for a dramatically shorter time period. Pots also have a more lightweight feel after being raku fired.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect that happens often with the multi-colored high shine and slightly metallic finish that is common in raku glazes is that after time passes, the color dulls due to oxidation. With the horsehair or feather method, the pot is taken out of the kiln and rather than being reduced in an airtight chamber such as in the Western method, it is left to be shocked by the air temperature and not reduced at all. These pots have no glaze on them at all, they are left bare and then burned with the horsehair or feathers while they are still hot. This process is very hands-on and produces some very interesting and beautiful results.</p>
<p>Raku firing is a very amazing process with a lot of science and history behind it. The history, process, and uniqueness of these pots are some of the many reasons that this method of firing is so prominent in the field of pottery. Learning about the rich history contributes to being able to participate in this process with added context and a wider outlook.</p>

            <p>Ultra-high Temperature Ceramics<br>
N. Shipley</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
The highest cone that exists on the pyrometric chart is ∆42. This temperature only exists in the creation of certain industrial ceramics, and for all intents and purposes is something the ordinary ceramicist will never encounter. However, certain types of ceramics can function well above ∆42! These types of ceramics are referred to as <em>ultra-high temperature ceramics</em>, or UHTCs for short. UHTCs are surprisingly hard to define, so three different definitions will be provided:</p>
<ol>
<li>UHTCs are ceramic materials that melt above 3000˚C.</li>
<li>UHTCs are ceramic materials that are available for use in air above 1600-2000˚C.</li>
<li>UHTCs are any compound that contains a transition metal (Zr, Hf, Ta, W, or Nb) along with B, C, or N (Fahrenholtz).</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these definitions has its own limitations. To start, only W, Ta, or Re meet the first criterion, that the material must melt above 3000˚C. The second definition is helpful from an engineering standpoint, but depends greatly on the length of time the material is exposed to air. The third definition is the most widely used, but falls short when it is applied to composite UHTCs, such as ZrB2 – SiC (Fahrenholtz).</p>
<p>UHTCs have been known by different names, including “refractory borides,” or “refractory carbides,” “oxidation-resistant diborides,” “ceramals,” “cermets,” and “hard metals”. The term “ultra-high temperature ceramics” has only become popular in the past 20-30 years as interest in and research on the materials has increased (Fahrenholtz).</p>
<p><strong>History</strong><br>
The story of UHTCs is fascinating and checkered, and cannot be told without delving into the Cold War, the space race, or the U.S. military. The precursor of some of the most widely-used UHTCs, ZrB2, was discovered in 1902 by Samuel A. Tucker and Herbert R. Moody. Although a few initial studies on the material’s bonding and electrical properties were conducted in the following years, by and large the scientific community paid the discovery little attention (Royal Society).</p>
<p>Interest in UHTCs perked up again in the 1950s, as tensions increased between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The escalating Cold War and concomitant interest in spaceflight pushed scientists to investigate boride and carbide ceramics for their potential use in rocket nozzles. Although no reusable aerospace vehicles at the time reached ultra-high temperatures, NASA scientists realized that future vehicles would likely necessitate advances in materials science (Fahrenholtz).</p>
<p>1960s research by the U.S. Air Force into reusable atmospheric reentry vehicles identified boride ceramics as candidates for leading edge materials, as sharp leading edges of such vehicles can reach temperatures of over 2000˚C. HfB2 and ZrB2 eventually became prime candidates for research and applications in atmospheric reentry (Fahrenholtz). Research by the U.S. military in the 1970s into hypersonic flight likewise advanced the field of UHTCs (Justin and Jankowiak).</p>
<p><strong>Physical Properties</strong><br>
UHTCs can be classified as borides, carbides, or nitrides. They are characterized by their high melting points, high hardness, low reactivity, and (in some cases) resistance to oxidation (Justin and Jankowiak). Each of these categories posses their own strengths and shortcomings.</p>
<p>The borides, such as ZrB2 and HfB2 have hexagonal crystal structures. Their intrinsic thermal conductivities (intrinsic referring to properties that have nothing to do with processing) are quite high. This means that borides are good in applications where there is a large, rapid increase in temperature, such as in rocket nozzles (Wuchina et al). Borides do have some trouble with oxidation, and as such there has been much research into their oxidation resistance. In particular, SiO2-forming species are promising additives, because as the ceramic oxidizes the additives melt and form a protective layer of glass (Wuchina et al).</p>
<p>The carbides have very high melting points—much higher than those of the borides (Table 1). TaC and HfC in particular have been the subject of much research because of their high melting temperature, hardness, and strength. Unfortunately, when in oxidation the carbides are subject to pesting, which is when oxide grains break off instead of densifying. However, this becomes less of a problem when temperatures rapidly increase from a baseline to above 2000˚C, as then the oxides are able to properly densify. As such, carbides are not as useful in leading edges, which are subject to large amounts of oxidation as well as slower increases in temperature, but are useful in low-oxygen environments, as they then perform as well as or better than their boride counterparts (Wuchina et al).</p>
<p>Nitrides are less well-understood than borides or carbides. They have very high melting temperatures: HfN melts at around 3300˚C, and under some conditions can even reach 3800˚C without melting. Nitrides also operate over a range of chemical ratios (stoichiometries). At high temperatures over long periods, nitrides will lose their nitrogen, which can lead to structural failure and disintegration (Wuchina et al).</p>
<p><strong>Preparation, Densification, and Machining</strong><br>
The fabrication of UHTCs begins by creating the precursors, which exist as powders prior to their densification. The powders are typically synthesized through reduction or direct reaction (Wuchina et al). Powder blends are ball-milled to increase particle uniformity and decrease size, and are then sieved (Justin and Jankowiak). The blends are then typically densified by hot-pressing (~1800˚C and ~27MPa) the powder mixtures in graphite molds (Wuchina et al). Currently, there is some research into pressureless spark plasma sintering, which would enable complex shapes and could also be done at lower temperatures. This technique is also promising because it leads to comparatively smaller grain size, which increases the strength of the material (Justin and Jankowiak).</p>
<p>UHTCs are typically either hot-pressed into their desired shapes or machined. Machining is often an expensive, difficult, and unreliable process due to UHTCs’ brittle nature, and is accomplished by grinding with diamond tools. Advances in machining such as electrical discharge machining offers a cheap and precise alternative to typical machining techniques (Justin and Jankowiak).</p>
<p><strong>Health and Safety</strong><br>
The average ceramic artist is unlikely to come into contact with UHTCs, whether it be in the studio or elsewhere. Furthermore, unless one works in the manufacture of UHTCs or in a lab, it is highly unlikely one will come in contact with the materials in their powdered form. That being said, the health effects of powdered UHTCs are either negligible or unknown. Of the two most common UHTC precursors, HfB2 and ZrB2, HfB2 causes skin, eye, and respiratory irritation, while ZrB2 causes only minor irritation. HfB2 is not known to be a carcinogen, and it is unknown whether ZrB2 has carcinogenic properties. ZrB2 is somewhat flammable in its powder form (LTS Laboratory).</p>
<p><strong>Applications</strong><br>
UHTCs are valuable in a wide range of fields, including manufacture, electronics, aerospace, and nuclear energy. In manufacture they are commonly found in furnace elements or refractory crucibles (Justin and Jankowiak). Certain nitride UHTCs are essential in the microelectronics industry, and are used as diffusion barriers—barriers that prevent diffusion between between metal components (Wuchina et al).</p>
<p>Without UHTCs, advances in hypersonic flight and aerospace in general would not have been possible. The sharp aerosurfaces of hypersonic flight vehicles can reach temperatures between 2000˚C and 2400˚C, but must also be able to operate in air and be reusable. These high temperatures occur because thin leading edges increase lift-to-drag ratios, but also increase temperatures. UHTCs are essential in this context because they possess a high thermal conductivity, which reduces thermal stress by decreasing the magnitude of the thermal gradient and allows energy to be conducted away from the edge and be radiated out by materials with lower heat fluxes. In other words, heat travels quickly in UHTCs, which reduces internal stresses and allows the heat to quickly disperse (Justin and Jankowiak).</p>
<p>There is potential for use of UHTCs in nuclear pellets, which currently suffer from poor thermal and structural properties. UHTCs are also potentially fissile and offer superior thermal conductivity and phase stability. Furthermore, advances in nuclear technology, such as the development of Tokamak fusion reactors, will necessitate UHTCs. Tokamaks, which contain plasma within a magnetic field, often reach extreme temperatures on their interiors due to stray neutrons let off by the plasma (Fahrenholtz). Applications such as these are on the cutting edge of materials science, and will likely require huge leaps in scientific knowledge, manufacturing techniques, and materials engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
Although the average ceramic artist is unlikely to encounter ultra-high temperature ceramics during their career, it is still worth keeping track of and paying attention to these materials. Their use in industry, warfare, energy, and more irrevocably ties them to the lives of ordinary people, whether they know it or not. It is worth critically examining the histories and uses of these materials in order to uncover their role in global power systems (as for instance in their use in warfare), perpetuation of environmental issues (nuclear reactors), or opportunities for cleaner energy (fusion reactors). Furthermore, their unusual physical properties, fabrication techniques, and histories offer opportunities for artistic inspiration and creation.</p>

            <p>Marbling Your Ceramics</p>
<p>One of the recent fads that has hit the art scene is marbling.  While marbling has an extensive history, has reappeared in painting, papercraft, textiles, and ceramics.  Artists have been using marble to sculpt for thousands of years and can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece (Shovava &amp;Comma 2019).  Though it wasn’t until the 10th century in Japan that the origin of marbling began with paper marbling, Suminagashi.  Since then, it has evolved into a various patterns and techniques on a multitude of different art media, including ceramics.  Marbling ceramics can be achieved in three distinct methods: as a clay body, through slip decoration, and through glazing.  As I explore the history of marbling and its impact on the ceramic world, I will experiment with the ceramic techniques and challenges each pose.</p>
<p>Marbling began in Japan around the 10th century in the form of Suminagashi, or “floating ink”.  Artists would add drops of black and indigo blue ink to water, the blow gently on the surface to create the smoky pattern.  Paper was laid on top to imprint the pattern and left to dry.  Later on, in the 15th century, Turkey and Persia created their form of marbling called Ebru, “cloud art”.  Their methodology consisted of oil paints and gouaches instead of inks.  To keep the heavier paints from sinking, a thickening agent called  <em>size</em>  was added to water, which allowed the paints to stay on the surface and gave the artist more control in creating patterns.  Once the paint was settled on the water surface, a feather, comb or stylus was used to created intricate patterns that would then be transferred to paper.  Marbling paper finally appeared in Europe during the 17thcentury when travelers to the Middle East collected the highly stylized papers and bound them into  <em>alba amicorum</em> , “books of friendship”, the predecessor to autograph books.  As popularity grew for marbled paper, Renaissance scientists began publishing accounts of marblers’ techniques and tools which was widely disseminated throughout the rest of Europe.  In the 19th century it became a popular handicraft after being published in Charles Woolnough’s The Art of Marbling (1853) (“History of Suminagashi and Marbling”).</p>
<p>During this paper marble craze is when marbling first begins to appear on ceramic vessels in Europe as a clay body, inspired by 8th century T’ang dynasty wares.  The earliest documented thrown agateware was found among the products of John Dwight, the father of English pottery.  His research of clay bodies for agateware included notes on shrinkage rates, body compatibility and colors, firing temperatures, densities, plasticity, elasticity and strength.  Laid agateware was introduced commercially in the early 1700s by Dr. Thomas Wedgwood with varicolored clays in marbled effect created in press molds.  By the 1740s potter Thomas Whieldon improved on Wedgwood’s methodology by using white clay stained with metallic oxides.  Towards the latter half of the 18th century, the hype of agateware began to die out, but sporadically popped up in other pottery centers in the 19th century.  American agateware technology made its appearance in mid-17thcentury at a tobacco pipe kiln in Maryland, but the best-known examples came from the U.S. Pottery Co. in the mid-19th century called “scroddled ware” This was a cheap way of producing pottery which refers to ware that has been created out of scraps of various clays combined to form striations in the clay body or the addition of iron slag into clay body to create the striations.  Agateware makes a brief reappearance in American art during the Arts and Crafts Movement of the 1900s.  The Niloak Pottery Co. in Arkansas created the “Mission Swirl” line of pottery made from three different local clays (cream, brown, and grey) and three colored clays (red, white, and blue).  The clays were then press molded giving their shape (Ceramics in America).</p>

<p>While the history of agateware is extensive, there is little documentation on the history of marbling as a surface adornment.  The difference between the three methods of marbling is: colorant in clay body (agateware), surface color from slips, and surface color from glaze.  As I explored each type of marbling, I found that each technique varies in difficult, with agateware being the easiest and glazing being the most difficult.</p>
<p>Marbling Clay</p>
<p>To preface this marbling option, it does take a significant amount of mason stain to color a white clay body.  The Vanadium color I chose made the clay body look slightly discolored (even after 100g), so I added in an additional 50g of Titanium Yellow.  Also, be sure to use the same body as a mix of bodies could create issues during firing especially if fired at different temperatures.</p>
<ul>
<li>·  Helmer Porcelain (made from large batch)
<ul>
<li>Helmer  100 lbs</li>
<li>Custer Feldspar  50  lbs</li>
<li>Roseville  15  lbs</li>
<li>Flint  25  lbs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Combine dry mix.  Add 500g of water and blend.</li>
<li>Remove 1/3 of mix.  This will be for the stained portion of the body.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>a.  To note: you can remove more but you want the ratio to be less than 1:1 between the bodies to create a good marble pattern.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add stain to 1/3 mix to desired color.  Colorants may stain, be sure to wear proper protection.</li>
<li>Dry both mixes separately until plastic.</li>
<li>Wedge both bodies separately.  Remove portions of stained body and add to unstained body.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/a2dc2667366472d08201a9fe35619b2706c6c920.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="neJ1cIR5pAizpVOsPNaoPabJJM4" width="86" height="115"></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Wedge bodies together about 5-10 times.  Do not over wedge as colors will become blended and not marbled.</li>
<li>Throw form on wheel.  Allow to dry to leather hard (for trimming and color reveal).  Initially your form will look muddied on the surface with no actual marbling, but after trimming off the surface layer you will reveal the marbling underneath.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/598319133211c581e6c8c82e3b71539bb801c859.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="cLRmZR9I2zNjqDopymk6MaECrwt" width="88" height="118"><br>
In hindsight, I think using a more vibrant color other than yellow would have been a better option for a clay body.  The marbling is still present but is subtle.</p>
<p>Marbling Slips (G. January, Irene, et al)</p>
<p>I have not been able to successfully marble slips on a thrown form, as of yet.  This form of marbling is easier done on slabs.  Marbling with slips, and with glazes, does utilize CMC powder with helps keep the slip in suspension to create the marble effect.  I reused the same recipe from the clay body as the slip as my color variant in this method and added CMC mix.</p>
<ul>
<li>·  Black Slip</li>
<li>Red Art  80</li>
<li>EPK  10</li>
<li>Talc  10</li>
<li>Manganese Dioxide  4</li>
<li>Red Iron Oxide  12</li>
<li>Black Mason Stain  5</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Roll slab out to ¼” thickness.  Place on nonporous plank, this allows the clay to stick to the surface without falling off while creating the marbling effect.  Put colored slip into squeeze bottle.</li>
<li>Coat slab in black slip and quickly drizzle colored slip onto slab.  Over a bucket, tip the slab upwards to allow the slips to move.  Rotate the slab in various directions to create desired effect.  Lay flat and allow slip to dry until it is no longer tacky.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/15ba515a8b4e6ad4de0c611158865ae24a2ea940.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="36dd4H6yH1utdaWEvyaEcXRoRlC" width="90" height="120"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Cut out desired shape and place on a plaster mold.  The timing between steps 2 and 3 is crucial.  If the slip is still tacky the design will come off on the mold.  If the clay is too dry it will crack when placed on the mold.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/8da7b04f4004ab167446c15221545ca59e2f88af.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="kd8ASaeriqgTOhoeC8Xrrj6En9B" width="90" height="120"></p>
<p>My first attempt of slip marbling, I did not add CMC to the colored slip.  This created a less than desirable effect as the two slips weren’t allowed to move together.  The colored slip remained on the surface of the black slip due to different densities.  The effect for the failed marbling was also done on a kick wheel which created the “starburst” result instead of the standard marbling.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/06fc3be753044c086dc552c597f8df94e58d5399.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="ZNgXZIPW1mMx218YKle2f5eBDj" width="91" height="121"></p>
<p>Marbling Glaze (“The Ceramic School”)</p>
<p>This technique takes patience and constant movement.  While this form seems easiest, it was also the most unsuccessful after firing.  I am sure with some fine tuning and adjustments within the glazes and possibly at a lower temperature (was fired to cone 10) this effect will be more successful in coming trials.  It is important to note, again, the importance of the CMC powder in the glazes.  The difference in densities creates a separation between the glazes.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/6cdfa6ed32d892929ca277943b727ddb9e985122.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="fx8JPdtgSWSYTgv6sY0d5x5Bbd8" width="95" height="126"></p>

<li>·  White Glaze
<ul>
<li>Custer Feldspar  60</li>
<li>Gerstley Borate  6</li>
<li>Ball Clay  11</li>
<li>Whiting  17</li>
<li>Zinc  5</li>
<li>Lithium Carb.  1.7</li>
<li>Zircopax  10</li>
<li>Bentonite  2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>·  Yellow Glaze
<ul>
<li>Minspar  40</li>
<li>Talc  20</li>
<li>Flint  20</li>
<li>EPK  10</li>
<li>Whiting  10</li>
<li>Titanium Yellow  10</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Add colored glaze to squeeze bottle for application.</li>
<li>Dip bisque ware into white glaze.  Drizzle colored glaze onto white glaze and rotate, allowing glazes to flow creating marbled effect.</li>
<li>Continue rotating, as it can take the glaze quite some time to dry and a stop in motion can cause flaws within the effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>As stated above, my before and after of this application proved to be unsuccessful.  The glazes seem to have run together instead of maintaining the effect of the before product during the firing.  The yellow also changed into a grey glaze (stain is TITANIUM yellow) with yellow and red mottling, which was unexpected.</p>

<p>The aesthetic of marble has been a long-standing tradition within the artist community for thousands of years and has had lasting effects on various media throughout history.  From the paper marbling of ancient Japan to trends of modern day, we can see the evolution of marbling through the change in patterning, the methodology in application, and the media it adorns.</p>

          <title>Dichroic Effect in Glass and Glaze</title>

            <p>Dichroic Effect in Glass and Glaze</p>
<p>There are many ways in the ceramic field to create a variety of colors and spectacular effects on glazes. However, when the kiln is opened, and the glazes are revealed, the color you see is the color you get… or is it? The awesome truth is no, the dichroic effects found in ancient glass have been rediscovered and augmented. Science and chemistry have explained the ancient mystery of how something can be seen as two different colors and dichromatic effects are now being utilized in the ceramic field.</p>
<p>Dichroic comes from the word dichroism which, according to Merriam-Webster 2019 edition dictionary, is a property some crystals and solutions demonstrate when they don’t absorb, transmit, and reflect polarized light planes equally. In other words, as you observe an object with true dichroism the observed color changes according to what is illuminating it and/or according to what light is bouncing off it. When observing reflected light (or the light that is being bounced back to you), the dichroic effect will show a completely different color from what you observe when seeing the transmitted light (or the light filtering through the object). A good example of this effect is found in a cup from Late Roman era, 4th century AD (Brill, 2019). This glass cup shows a green color when seeing the reflected light and a red color when seeing transmitted light.<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/dc5d6adff7d1fc7de3670b00902e9d16d589af10.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="vrrbKxuxB2Y31MzEpQ0iCWJbb4Q" width="159" height="169"></p>
<p>Another form of dichroism is glass that contains forms of rare earths and sometimes transition element oxides. These glasses only have the transmitted light qualities of dichroism. They Change color to the human eye depending on the type of light illuminating them. An example of this type can be found in Moser Glasses (Brill, 2019).<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/4a7481542537a2b9c66f9cb8a4f5151f492c0925.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="aCEWwRgOc6kVs4dm5lyiZsRgx0h" width="147" height="154"><br>
The more modern form of what we call dichroic is a bit removed from true dichroism, in that it is an interference filter adapted from a vacuum thin film deposition process discovered in 1887, and used by scientists at NASA in the 1950’s and 1960’s (Sandberg, 2019). It is a sort of scientific cheat in that they created a screen that blocks the passage of certain directional light waves. These glasses were layered with extremely thin films of metal oxides in order to shield the instruments on space craft from cosmic radiation and the eyes of astronauts from unfiltered sunlight (High Tech Art, 1993). Today there are many wider applications for dichroic films including fiber optics, laser guidance systems, art glass, and much more (Sandberg, 2019).<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/7c5abfd577c76b67187818513d4681b510f11b69.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="hK5DqunFR4FQ9i1ByH8gsPPmZhT" width="188" height="169"><br>
In the mid 70’s an artist and engineer named Murray Schwartz was dumpster diving for rejected aerospace mirrors behind a GM Vacuum Coating Laboratory in Newport Beach, when he was confronted by an employee named Jerry Sandberg. This chance encounter led the two men to a research partnership that culminated in the first three dichroic color specific coatings. These color specific mirrors were spectacular however creating them was costly.<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/01b46bd3fb6dfafd625f814ef1b305330a2b9312.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="f51K4NjkcJTxCz8iBGkdXWxjGy" width="258" height="246"><br>
Eventually Schwartz ‘s wife, a glass fusing artist named Rupama, used a piece of their coated mirror glass in one of her glass fusing’s and the spectacular results spurred further experimentation with using dichroic coatings for other art applications and contributed to a flourishing business, selling dichroic coated glass to artists (Sandberg, 2019). The techniques Schwartz and Sandburg developed for achieving a wide range of colors in their dichroic glass are described on the Coatings by Sandberg website.</p>
<p>A breakthrough came for ceramic artists when Coatings by Sandberg introduced a product that separates the dichroic flash from its substrate creating a fine film on copper that can be removed and crushed into glitter to be applied directly to glass, plastic, and porcelain.</p>
<p>In an article written by John Conrad for Ceramic Arts Daily, Conrad shares different techniques for <a href="https://ceramicartsnetwork.org/pottery-making-illustrated/pottery-making-techniques/ceramic-decorating-techniques/glitter-flashing/#" rel="nofollow noopener">applying dichroic film to ceramic pottery</a>. This way of creating a dichroic effect on glaze uses dichroic glitter with a glue like medium of CMC Gum and water to stick the particles on to the surface of a finished piece of pottery. Once the CMC Gum is dry, a layer of clear glaze is carefully sprayed to cover the dichroic film and the piece is re-fired. The results from this create vessels with floating flecks of dichroic metal oxides sandwiched between layers of glaze. The results are more visible when applying the colorful metallic glitter to a glazed surface as they tend to be very subdued on white porcelain (Conrad, 2015).<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/c01fbc173f1463504ae39c96f39f73f9a69a5df9.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rpBFgQ39iEn7AUo2E6GyxQWb4Zr" width="562" height="614"></p>
<p>The dichroic effect can also be achieved in creating glazes through an understanding of crystal field theory. A glaze formulation and technical manual for dichroic glazes, written by Jenn Wicks and Ryan Coppage, describes crystal field theory as a way of understanding electron valence systems that allows us to “change the color properties of a metal colorant or pigment based on the splitting of energy between orbitals”. In their book,  <em>The Mechanism of (and Recipes for) Dichroic Glazes</em>  (2019), Wicks and Coppage explain that,</p>
<p>The way in which we perceive the colors of transition metals has to do with how   photons (light) are absorbed [… ] Essentially, the surrounding glaze environment   encapsulates a metal, and oxygen atoms (or other components in the recipe) coordinate   themselves around the metal – typically in an octahedral or tetrahedral geometry. Based   on identity and arrangement of the surroundings, the electrons in the different d-orbitals   can experience energy repulsions, which causes a split in energy between the existing   orbitals. Such a change in energy, due to electrons not filling every orbital, allows for the   absorption of light of specific frequencies (photons); the rest is reflected off of the   surface, transmitted back to our eye, and is rebuilt into the color we see (p.147).</p>
<p>In their manual, Wicks and Coppage explore the dichroic responses rare earth oxides (neodymium oxide, erbium oxide, holmium oxide, and praseodymium oxide) have across different light sources. Their work shows that Neodymium oxide and Holmium oxide are the two rare earth oxides that have the most noticeable differences in color across different light sources when used in glaze formulations.<br>

From mysterious origins in ancient glassware where tiny amounts of colloidal gold and/or silver created a mystical color changing cup, to rare earth and transition element oxides, in the late 1800’s, creating radiation and light spectrum protection for astronauts, dichroic effects have captivated scientists and artists alike. Modern glaze chemistry and vacuum thin film deposition have enabled us to branch out of glass and into many other mediums with the spectacular and colorful effects of dichroism. When color variation, crystal formation, and the various textures of glazing aren’t enough, artists and potters alike can now enjoy the ambiguity of color like that of “the dress” only with much crisper and less ambiguous color shifts than washed out blue and black and with many more color options.<br>

            <p>Daniel De Montmollin is a Swiss potter (and a monk, « Frère Daniel »), born in 1921. He is well-known in Europe (and particularly in France), for his work on high-fire glazes and ash glazes. At most of the ceramics schools in France, glazes are taught according to his books <em>Pratique des Emaux de grès</em>, 1987, and <em>Pratique des Emaux de Cendres</em>, 1997. Both books are now edited as a single volume by <em>La Revue de la Céramique et du Verre</em>, a French editor, and frequently out-of-print. There is an English version that may be easier to get at times than the French version, depending on stocks.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the main part of the first book, where he explains the principles and use of so-called <em>melting diagrams</em>. Follows 60 diagrams, with only sparse commentary on some diagram sets, more fitted to achieve certain glazes (celadons, oilspots …). Generally the book is clear, with an easy-to-read and down-to-earth approach.</p>
<p>I tried to merely paraphrase the book, without distorting too much the text. Graphics are taken from my version of the book, which happens to be French. I translated “fusion” to melting, which seems more appropriate. Italics show my own text, rather than a translation.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to fusion (melting) diagrams</strong></p>
<p>Melting diagrams are a particular “screening” for the potter of more general (and complex) <em>phase diagrams</em>, which are an attempt to describe what happens to a mix of oxides during firing. These diagrams are not easy to find and hard to understand for the layman (aka potter). As an example is reproduced the phase diagram of a CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 system, extracted from the <em>Phase Equilibrium Diagrams of Oxide Systems, vol. 1</em>, published by the American Ceramics Society. This same book has been used as the base for establishing the melting diagrams.</p>

<p>If a sailor wants to go to a specific island without having a sea map, he will not succeed. Thus the melting diagrams give the coordinates of 60 “treasure” islands where the potter can land if he chooses to. One diagram will “locate” the melting zone of a glaze, however it will tell nothing about how the glaze will look like because many other parameters are involved.</p>
<p>Melting diagrams show that melting is a relational event, which depends on the relationships between the glazes components, rather than on a single one (which would be called a “flux” - <em>see more on this below</em>). For a given set of oxides, there are several possible relationships that may lead to melting, at a given temperature. In particular, when changing the silica and alumina amounts in a glaze, while keeping the base mole unchanged, it is possible to maintain this glaze inside its melting zone. This zone is precisely what the diagrams are showing: for a specific base mole (<em>Seger’s formula first column</em>), all the SiO2 and Al2O3 ratios that may lead to the melting of the glaze. SiO2 is measured in 0.5 moles on the Y axis, while Al2O3 is given in 0.05 moles on the X axis (<em>see Fig.15 below</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Temperature contour</strong></p>
<p>Let’s imagine an alpinist who would like to go around a mountain, staying at an altitude of 1300 m. To do so, he will follow the 1300 m contour on his map, ignoring the other contours. Likely, the diagrams show only the 1300°C temperature contour, typical of glazes high-firing. The diagram below shows the melting behavior of a CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 system. By following the contour, we get the melting at 1300°C, while by getting inside the curve the melting will occur at lower temperatures. Note that the contour is interrupted at 1.5 SiO2. Under this value, melting can still occur, but silicates will not form properly.</p>

<p>Obviously, other contours could be drawn (like on a geographical map), as an example a more complete map of this system is given, with at the core the minimum temperature of 1165°C (eutectic of this system).</p>

<p>In fact the graph above looks more like one of a seabed than of a mountain. A side view would look like this:</p>

<p>This “seabed” metaphor emphasizes the fact that there is no clear-cut border between fired and unfired, as, on the bank of a lake, there is no clear border between wet and dry (notwithstanding the map accuracy). So it is by wandering from one side of the line to the other side that the potter will find the best melting properties of a specific glaze.</p>
<p><strong>The diagrams index</strong></p>
<p>The shape and width of the “lake” will obviously change with the base mole components.</p>
<p>The diagrams in the book are limited to all possible combinations of CaO, MgO and KNaO (i.e. K2O+Na2O), in tenths of moles, to compose the base mole. Which gives the following triangle map:</p>

<p>Ex: Diagram 20 is the one with 0.5 CaO, 0.3 MgO 0.2 KNaO.</p>
<p>The unnumbered points near MgO are combinations that are not melting at 1300°C.</p>
<p><strong>How to use the diagrams</strong></p>
<p><em>There are 4 exercises presented to demonstrate the use of the diagrams. Here are the two first ones.</em></p>
<p><strong>The cutting</strong></p>
<p>As the border between melted and not-melted is not a sheer line, the potter can do some “cuts” at several, well-separated regions of the diagrams to explore melting (here on diagram 27):</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/332a6d29f90d3b2961a11b9e9daa580dbc8915d8.jpeg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/332a6d29f90d3b2961a11b9e9daa580dbc8915d8" title="IMG_0005.jpg"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/332a6d29f90d3b2961a11b9e9daa580dbc8915d8_2_345x301.jpeg" alt="IMG_0005" data-base62-sha1="7iDfrR5ImZMQbb9LQfgjKYoljhm" width="345" height="301" srcset="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/332a6d29f90d3b2961a11b9e9daa580dbc8915d8_2_345x301.jpeg, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/332a6d29f90d3b2961a11b9e9daa580dbc8915d8_2_517x451.jpeg 1.5x, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/332a6d29f90d3b2961a11b9e9daa580dbc8915d8_2_690x602.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/332a6d29f90d3b2961a11b9e9daa580dbc8915d8_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p><strong>The sweeping</strong></p>
<p>One can also explore more thoroughly the whole melting area of the diagram (here on diagram 18):</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/e5753dc99e8870c1aa868e32581ebbf10ca83ed0.jpeg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/e5753dc99e8870c1aa868e32581ebbf10ca83ed0" title="IMG_0006.jpg"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e5753dc99e8870c1aa868e32581ebbf10ca83ed0_2_345x290.jpeg" alt="IMG_0006" data-base62-sha1="wJSwObbOslLzN1zuqPSQaOpnnm8" width="345" height="290" srcset="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e5753dc99e8870c1aa868e32581ebbf10ca83ed0_2_345x290.jpeg, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e5753dc99e8870c1aa868e32581ebbf10ca83ed0_2_517x435.jpeg 1.5x, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e5753dc99e8870c1aa868e32581ebbf10ca83ed0_2_690x580.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e5753dc99e8870c1aa868e32581ebbf10ca83ed0_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p><strong>The “flux” concept</strong></p>
<p>The term “flux” is often used by potters. But according to the diagrams, it is not really a proper term. For instance, let’s consider diagram 27, and mark points A and B, far from the melting zone of the glaze. For the glaze to melt, we have to come nearer the contour one way or another. For point A, we could decrease silica, which seems logical, since silica has a high melting point. But we could as well increase Al2O3, and by much, even if alumina is even more refractory than silica.  For point B, it’s the reverse. Decreasing alumina (which seems logical), but also increasing silica, which is not!</p>
<p>It shows that it is not an oxide alone that melts a glaze, but the relationship between oxides.</p>

<p><strong>Other topics in the introduction</strong></p>
<p><em>The rest of the introduction chapter provides succinct information about the influence of the firing length on melting, melting and atmosphere, melting and crawling, glaze melting adjustment, glazes overlay, etc</em> …</p>
<p><strong>Diagrams</strong></p>
<p><em>60 diagrams are reproduced, as per the triangular map.</em></p>
<p>Some diagrams have a vertical line, depending on the value of Al2O3 : this is the separation between glazes that can be made using feldspars, and glazes that can only be made using frits (because the alumina content is too low for a feldspar).</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Glaze recipes are best understood by looking at the amounts of the various oxides they contain, instead of their ingredients. The relative proportions of the oxides in a glaze determine - to a large degree - the behaviour of the glaze.</p>
<p>A useful way to understand the effect of a particular oxide is to create a series of glazes where all the other oxides remain in fixed proportion, and only the oxide of interest changes as you move along the series. For example, in the image below, Phosphorus oxide increases from left to right, while the other oxides remain the same.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/d71621db10e1edf71820fbffc07f83eac78045c2.jpeg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/d71621db10e1edf71820fbffc07f83eac78045c2" title="HG7%20Blue%20Red%20with%20additions%20of%20P2O5"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d71621db10e1edf71820fbffc07f83eac78045c2_2_690x173.jpeg" alt="HG7%20Blue%20Red%20with%20additions%20of%20P2O5" data-base62-sha1="uGK4BuU4HgFVFjW0ovq6Ch1wahc" width="690" height="173" srcset="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d71621db10e1edf71820fbffc07f83eac78045c2_2_690x173.jpeg, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d71621db10e1edf71820fbffc07f83eac78045c2_2_1035x259.jpeg 1.5x, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/d71621db10e1edf71820fbffc07f83eac78045c2.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d71621db10e1edf71820fbffc07f83eac78045c2_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>To understand the effect of <em>two</em> particular oxides, we can fix the proportions of all oxides except those two, and create a rectangular array of glazes where one oxide changes horizontally, and the other vertically. If these glazes are applied to test tiles, the fired tiles can be arranged in a grid which shows how the glaze changes as the two oxides vary. The example below shows a glaze where red iron oxide increases from left to right, and titanium dioxide increases from bottom to top:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/78d4e50114b9ba550db8e0fa77a776d12f822a6d.jpeg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/78d4e50114b9ba550db8e0fa77a776d12f822a6d" title="PinnellClear_RIO_TiO"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/78d4e50114b9ba550db8e0fa77a776d12f822a6d_2_690x504.jpeg" alt="PinnellClear_RIO_TiO" data-base62-sha1="heVq60JGzfO1lJkko6rRRq5XViR" width="690" height="504" srcset="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/78d4e50114b9ba550db8e0fa77a776d12f822a6d_2_690x504.jpeg, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/78d4e50114b9ba550db8e0fa77a776d12f822a6d_2_1035x756.jpeg 1.5x, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/78d4e50114b9ba550db8e0fa77a776d12f822a6d_2_1380x1008.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/78d4e50114b9ba550db8e0fa77a776d12f822a6d_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>These glazes can be plotted as points on a grid, which can be used to estimate the regions where some property of the glazes holds. In this case, the regions where the glazes are more bluish and more greenish are shown:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/777d7be9ca06ad1b05d1db3826fc5cb5abe0b638.jpeg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/777d7be9ca06ad1b05d1db3826fc5cb5abe0b638" title="RIO_TiDi"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/777d7be9ca06ad1b05d1db3826fc5cb5abe0b638.jpeg" alt="RIO_TiDi" data-base62-sha1="h33Fn45IJaWuK8J3WnoOH1GQ4TS" width="690" height="312" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/777d7be9ca06ad1b05d1db3826fc5cb5abe0b638_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>The division of glazes into these two groups is a simplification; in reality, the colour changes continuously from blueish to greenish. In the same way, the different regions in the charts shown below are simplifications of reality.</p>
<h2>The Stull chart</h2>
<p>The ‘Stull chart’, drawn by R. T. Stull in 1912, is a particular example of this type of grid, where the oxides silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) vary. The diagram below depicts the properties of the glazes where silica increases from left to right, and alumina increases from bottom to top. The hatched region shows glazes that craze.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/729a56976a4a278d0653eafadd97d11bc2d1bd4c.jpeg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/729a56976a4a278d0653eafadd97d11bc2d1bd4c" title="465de18a"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/729a56976a4a278d0653eafadd97d11bc2d1bd4c.jpeg" alt="465de18a" data-base62-sha1="glP6bDGBrRF4dcRetQP3tU36nOk" width="517" height="517" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/729a56976a4a278d0653eafadd97d11bc2d1bd4c_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the top left corner, where SiO<sub>2</sub> is low and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is high, and in the bottom right corner, where SiO<sub>2</sub> is high and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is low, the glaze isn’t fully melted (the <em>UNFUSED</em> and <em>DEVITRIFIED</em> regions both denote immature glazes). Although the chart doesn’t extend far enough to show this, glazes which have both excessively high SiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> also won’t melt. A rough approximation of the enlarged chart is shown below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/fc61c85b8fd2988af1a34f7e63be05126ab9f73e.jpeg" alt="Stull%20mature%20glazes" data-base62-sha1="A0FOTzsI1X2RAnHEaCqOOc5euJ0" width="419" height="418"></p>
<ul>
<li>The region where the glazes are mature is divided into three sub-regions, <em>MATTES</em>, <em>SEMI-MATTES</em>, and <em>BRIGHT</em>, which here means glossy. Glazes on the boundary between the matte and semi-matte regions all have roughly 4 molecules of SiO<sub>2</sub> for every molecule of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, while glazes on the boundary between the semi-matte and glossy regions all have roughly 5 molecules of SiO<sub>2</sub> for every molecule of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. In other words, glazes with a SiO<sub>2</sub> : Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratio of less than about 4 are matte, glazes with a SiO<sub>2</sub> : Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratio greater than about 5 are glossy, and the ones in between are semi-matte. Glazes that are underfired will generally be matte / semi-matte.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/bca41537e2da09571da3be19e62ab6b01c72b645.png" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/bca41537e2da09571da3be19e62ab6b01c72b645" title="image"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/bca41537e2da09571da3be19e62ab6b01c72b645.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="qUNjfbvzunz2XdjQM8yj4c0UQKh" width="690" height="463" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/bca41537e2da09571da3be19e62ab6b01c72b645_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<ul>
<li>Glazes with low SiO<sub>2</sub> or low Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> craze, as do underfired glazes with high SiO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This chart was constructed by fixing the proportions of all oxides other than silica and alumina, and firing to cone 11 (the actual proportions used can be found in the original <a href="https://wiki.glazy.org/t/influences-of-variable-silica-and-alumina-on-porcelain-glazes/766">paper</a>). If the oxides other than silica and alumina were fixed in different proportions, or the glazes were fired to a different <a href="https://wiki.glazy.org/t/measuring-heatwork-temperature-with-orton-cones/509">cone</a>, the resulting chart might look somewhat different, but the three observations above would still hold in most cases, more or less.</p>
<h2>Using the Stull chart</h2>
<p>Although Glazy shows a version of the Stull chart as a background image when plotting SiO<sub>2</sub> vs Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, this can’t always be relied on to predict whether a glaze will be matte or glossy, mature or not, or crazed or not. Rather think of it as a metaphor that describes the big picture.</p>
<p>Some of the many factors that affect a glaze are the proportions of the oxides other than silica and alumina, the cone to which the glaze is fired, the cooling rate of the kiln, and the claybody on which the glaze is fired. All of these have the potential to modify the chart. However, the overview of the glaze landscape that the chart provides can still be useful. To make an analogy, imagine being lost in a dense forest, with only a compass and a map. If the map shows that the forest gradually transitions to open country towards the north-east, you’ll be able to head out of the forest, despite not knowing your exact location on the map.</p>
<p>For example, if you’d like to change a glossy glaze to a matte, you can modify the glaze by decreasing the silica-alumina ratio. If the glaze contains enough silica as an ingredient, the simplest way to do this is by removing some of the silica. The example below shows a glaze where progressively more silica has been removed, moving from right to left.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/49b984a55dbb6738c5119d3a11b0d15abe79b908.jpeg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/49b984a55dbb6738c5119d3a11b0d15abe79b908" title="BOB%20silica%20line%20blend"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/49b984a55dbb6738c5119d3a11b0d15abe79b908_2_690x148.jpeg" alt="BOB%20silica%20line%20blend" data-base62-sha1="awckdGRfh1Vv2BcWHR9MAiS4F1C" width="690" height="148" srcset="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/49b984a55dbb6738c5119d3a11b0d15abe79b908_2_690x148.jpeg, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/49b984a55dbb6738c5119d3a11b0d15abe79b908_2_1035x222.jpeg 1.5x, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/49b984a55dbb6738c5119d3a11b0d15abe79b908_2_1380x296.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/49b984a55dbb6738c5119d3a11b0d15abe79b908_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Knowing the general behaviour of the map can be useful in identifying potentially problematic glazes. If you have a glaze with a SiO<sub>2</sub> : Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratio well above 5 that fires matte, this may be a sign that it isn’t fully mature. There may be other reasons, as explained <a href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_matte_glaze.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The extent of the crazed region can vary a great deal, since it depends strongly on the claybody on which the glaze is applied. However, the chart shows that a general rule of thumb to decrease crazing is to increase both silica and alumina. Other options are given <a href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/troubleshooting/ceramic_troubleshooting_glaze_crazing.html">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Oil Spot Glazes</p>

Glaze Formulation<br>
Matt Katz<br>
August 9th, 2019</p>
<p>The aesthetic of the oil spot glaze has been captivating viewers since it was developed during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) in the Fujian province of China. Tea bowls with this highly prized surface were traded throughout east Asia, and the Japanese began developing their own glazes to mimic them.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[1]</a>In Japan, they were called Temmoku in reference to the Chinese mountain range Tianmu Shan. Generally speaking, the image that comes to mind when referring to a Temmoku glaze, is a deep brown or black that breaks over edges with a lighter reddish brown. But Temmoku can also refer to an entire glaze category, which includes glazes with striking effects such as the oil spot.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[2]</a>The potters of the Jianyang kilns in the Fujian province had specific methods for achieving this alluring glaze, which have been deciphered through excavation and analysis of sherds from the original kilns. Before attempting to understand how to create oil spot glazes today with modern technology, it is imperative to learn about this history and their technical choices. Much of the knowledge they had can be applied or modified to suit the needs of the modern potter.</p>
<p>In 2014, Pamela Vandiver and Chandra Reedy published an article on their findings from analyzing 30 sherds excavated by J.M. Plumer in 1935, from three kilns in Jianyang. They were able to determine information about glaze composition, application, and the firing process. It is important to note that the pieces they analyzed were not exclusively oil spots, but also included hare’s fur glazes. The significance of this fact is that no variation was found between the two in terms of glaze composition, meaning that the difference in the end product was due to variations in the firing process. All the glaze samples had a high iron content with calcium oxides, which had been applied to an iron-heavy body.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[3]</a>A high percentage of iron is one of the major keys to producing an oil spot glaze. When red iron oxide (Fe2O3) is heated, it converts to black iron oxide (FeO), releasing oxygen in the process. The calcium that is present in the glaze aids in breaking apart the iron and the oxygen.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[4]</a>When the oxygen bursts the surface of the glaze, it creates a crater. This occurrence is normally avoided by putting high iron glazes through an early reduction during the firing process. Starving the kiln of oxygen forces the chemically bonded oxygen in the red iron oxide to be released. When this happens before the glaze has begun melting, no oxygen bubbles will form and burst through the surface.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[5]</a>However, this “glaze flaw” is essential for creating the oil spot effect, which is why they must be fired in oxidation. The red iron oxide molecule will naturally release oxygen atoms at about 1230°C. This disrupts the homogeneity of the glaze, causing what is called phase separation.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[6]</a>When the oxygen leaves the glaze, a “spot” of iron remains.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[7]</a>As the firing continues, a layer of silica covers the blemished area, healing it. The potters in Jianyang had to be meticulous in their glaze application and firing techniques because viscosity and thickness plays an important role during this part of the glaze development in the kiln. Glaze thickness was around 3mm or more. If the glaze was applied too thinly, it would not produce a successful oil spot effect.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[8]</a>A certain balance must be achieved with the glaze viscosity. It must be stiff enough not to run, taking the iron spots with it. On the other hand, it cannot be so viscous that the oxygen bubbles fail to break the surface.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[9]</a>Historically these wares were glazed as greenware, placed on setters, and protected with a saggar as they were fired to 1230-1300°C. The saggar served to regulate both the temperature and the oxidation state.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[10]</a></p>
<p>Today, it is more common to apply the glaze to bisque ware rather than leather hard pots for increased durability during the final firing. And although the saggar method is still valid, it is not always necessary. For example, firing in an electric kiln provides an oxidation atmosphere without the threat of debris from the firing melting onto the surface. Another major development in recent years is the ability to obtain an oil spot effect with mid-range firing, albeit with some drawbacks. Spotting at this temperature tends to be smaller because of the lower temperature.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[11]</a>Another method for obtaining the oil spot look that works for both mid-range and high fire temperatures is using a slip-based glaze with a cover coat glaze. In this scenario, the cover glaze must melt first so the oxygen bubble can burst through it.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[12]</a>Traditional oil spot glazes tend to be variations of brown or black depending on the colorant. Brown, rusty colored spots come from iron oxide and darker blacks come from the addition of cobalt carbonate.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[13]</a>Although the cover glaze method is not the traditional way of creating the oil spot aesthetic, it uses the same principle of forming two glasses at different times during the firing. One glass must create bubbles to break through the other before it heals over. The difference here is that the two glasses come from two different glazes and is not due to phase separation of one glaze. This alternation in the process makes it simpler to explore a wider range of color possibilities with the cover coat.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[14]</a>Another interesting oil spot development is the usage of opacifiers such as zirconium silicate in glaze recipes. When the bubble bursts, the opacifier collects in the crater, creating white spots.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[15]</a>This goes to show how a bit of knowledge and creativity can create a whole new branch of a glaze type.</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, the Jianyang potters mastered the oil spot glaze using the resources they had. The foundation of knowledge they amassed is one that potters continue to build on today. In the modern world, we are not limited to local materials as they were. Material accessibility makes it possible to explore the potential of oil spot glazes in ways that could not be done before. Continuing to analyze ceramics of the past while testing new glaze formulas and firing methods is certain to lead to more exciting developments for oil spot glazes in the future.</p>

            <p><strong>A GUIDE TO THROWING ON THE WHEEL</strong></p>
<p>Throwing is commonly defined as “the act of propelling something with a great force through the air.” Now in the ceramic world, “throwing” holds a whole different meaning. In this context, it is the entire activity of shaping one’s clay on the potter’s wheel.</p>
<p>Throwing is thought to be a bit more complex than hand building, having various steps one must follow to successfully complete such a task, however, it more often yields a cleaner &amp; symmetrical end result, which leads to its great appeal.<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/72544d1db13e865d49e399399439bdbf31b7fb38.jpeg" alt="THROWING-5" data-base62-sha1="gjp2Rz1o6gFUj1qgzJcUsLSDuac" width="324" height="147"></p>
<p>This technique is most commonly used for creating dishware, including plates, bowls, cups, vases, etc. This is due to its rotating ability to create perfectly rounded cylindrical forms. To successfully create something as simple as a standing cylinder cup, one must refer to the following steps, but first, one must ensure they have the right tools.</p>
<p><strong>SOME NECESSARY TOOLS</strong></p>
<p>A clean wheel surface/ a clean surface to wedge</p>
<p>Small bucket of water &amp; sponge</p>
<p>Needle tool</p>
<p>Wooden trimming tool</p>
<p>Wire tool<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/274ffd05e29e4c717550aaadb77dded3d550d673.jpeg" alt="THROWING-6" data-base62-sha1="5BLZJfovZZsYIaAnfSFVEpHsus3" width="174" height="75"><br>
<strong>STEP 1- WEDGE YOUR CLAY</strong></p>
<p>Before you even sit down at your wheel, you must wedge the clay you will be using. Wedging is defined as the “process of kneading the clay with one’s hands to remove air bubbles and ensure homogenous mass.” This is highly important since this step helps to prep your clay through compacting it, aligning its particles and creating uniformity throughout the whole form<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/37ecb92649d461f2507c16f8ee862f7ca77823b6.jpeg" alt="THROWING-7" data-base62-sha1="7YJr9Yl2x1XfkyW9RDaI6mXqlrU" width="139" height="157"><br>
You want to complete this kneading action on a smooth, cleaned surface. Work the clay repetitively for as long as desired (I personally do 50 counts of kneading minimum, depending on amount of clay). Once the clay has been wedged, form it into a ball shape.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2- CENTERING ON THE WHEEL</strong></p>
<p>I personally have seen this step done multiple ways; what I’m suggesting is my own personal tactic, so until you find a way that works best for you, I suggest the following.</p>
<p>Using medium force, hit the ball of clay as close to the wheel’s center as possible. Now you want to tuck your right elbow in between your right leg and your torso so your forearm is kind of resting against your thigh. This will help keep your hand steady while you work with the rotating clay.</p>
<p>Wet your clay with your sponge (the clay should be kept wet this entire time). If it dries out, it will catch in your hands easily and cause it to go off center. Keep the sponge wet &amp; placed in your left hand for now.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/0986f10d995789955897b895f8fb0780275187b9.jpeg" alt="THROWING-8" data-base62-sha1="1mhpjxgk5qjbtBc0ehyEkbSGHXj" width="134" height="151"><br>
Using your right hand, still tucked against your torso, push the clay toward the center of the wheel. Interchanging, use your left hand (with the sponge) to push the clay downwards. Repeat this action while wheel spins until centered.</p>
<p>The clay is perfectly centered once you can gently lay your finger against it without the finger bumping in or out. Visually, it will look like the clay isn’t even moving, while the wheel still rotates.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3- OPENING &amp; FORMING THE BOTTOM</strong></p>
<p>While the clay is rotating, locate the center of the wheel/ clay ball. Take your thumb of your right hand and place it at the center point. Apply pressure downwards with your left hand, creating a donut shape from above.</p>
<p>Push down until there is approximately 1/2 an inch of clay at the bottom. This will form the floor of your cup. If you aren’t sure the bottom’s thickness, then stop the wheel and measure it with your needle tool.</p>
<p>With the wheel spinning, pull your thumb outwards, towards yourself. Be sure to keep your right palm applied to the outer surface of the clay. Widen the opening to desired width, but be sure not to make the base too narrow; you will need to be able to fit your hand inside the opening as it grows taller.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/7e928717c235f93d8933e61c8a7de43098cd3ef2.jpeg" alt="THROWING-9" data-base62-sha1="i3I5URT7znFySBAgAeQ5f4Axf34" width="191" height="204"><br>
<strong>STEP 4- START PULLING</strong></p>
<p>Keep your wheel rotating &amp; clay continuously wet as you continue on. For this next step your left hand will go inside the opening while your right will stay on the outside, still tucked against your torso for stability.</p>
<p>Reduce the speed of the wheel. Your left forefinger will go inside, touching the bottom base of the wall, lightly resting on the floor of the cup; meanwhile you right hand will touch the same spot on the outside of the cup wall. Be sure to rest your left thumb on top of you right hand for further connection.</p>
<p>Keeping your hands connected, apply slight pressure, pinching clay between your forefingers and begin to move straight upward. By doing this, you thin the walls and stretch them, adding height. Continue for desired height, being aware of overall thickness.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/527a19b102b6cec334fcfa32741c57790e485cc5.jpeg" alt="THROWING-10" data-base62-sha1="bLCKAkfgSFMlR7dOcFAH3bUyyVv" width="175" height="254"><br>
Be sure to use your sponge and soak up all the water puddled inside the cup afterwards to avoid future cracking, as well as, remember to compress your lip; this includes, compressing the top gently to smooth out &amp; solidify your cup’s rim.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 5- TRIM &amp; CUT FINAL PRODUCT OFF WHEEL</strong></p>
<p>While the wheel is still slowly spinning, use the wedge-shaped end of your wooden trimming tool to trim the bottom of you cup; this includes the excess clay you were unable to pinch/ pull. Gently rotate the wheel while removing the trimmings away from your cup.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/505afd9784756f8e97f221794c4a6dbbb4c9c1f4.jpeg" alt="THROWING-11" data-base62-sha1="bsR8VQY9BNmI3MJF1nXk3gOtVcM" width="177" height="197"><br>
Keeping your cutting wire as taut as possible, stretch it to either side of the wheel head on the other side of you cup. Rotate the wheel very slowly, keeping the wire slightly touching the wheel surface. Pull the wire toward yourself in one smooth motion, scraping the surface of the wheel and crossing under the cup. Now you may stop the wheel &amp; carefully remove the cylindrical product.</p>
<p>Place the piece somewhere out of harm’s way, lightly covered in plastic. The plastic will ensure slow, safe and even drying. The cup will be ready for its bisque firing once it has reached its bone-dry phase.<br>

          <title>Types of clay: Know what you’re working with</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[emace]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Clay Bodies</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have recently taken an Introduction to Clays class, I’m focusing on the formation of clay and looking at specific types of clay. It has been a great experience to go at my own pace and review the material as needed to grasp its content. Being math and chemistry phobic, I have finally grasped some basics of how the elements interact. Knowing this will serve as a valuable tool to be able to achieve a desired effect in working with a clay body. Therefore, I thought I’d write about something I learned and found useful, which just touches on some different types of clay, and is by no means an exhaustive study.</p>
<p>When planning a project, it is important to be aware that some types of clay can be used alone while others, more than likely, will need to be mixed together with other types of clay to some extent to get one’s desired effect. Clays are a naturally occurring composition of elements derived from rocks, they take on different characteristics depending on how the minerals have been acted upon by natural forces, such as wind, rain, freezing, thawing and other weather conditions which help break down the rocks along with other forces like rivers, glaciers and gravity allowing rocks to fall and break apart. This helps clay particles to separate and settle together to make up various deposits.</p>
<p>A particular type of rock, referred to as a Feldspar, is a primary source of silica and<br>
alumina, of which clay is most usually composed. Clay is divided into two groups, primary and secondary. Primary clay refers to clay that has not moved from the location of the<br>
source rock that has decomposed and thus have the least amount of contamination. This is<br>
referred to as kaolin and that is the primary ingredient in porcelain. The theoretically pure<br>
kaolin formula is Al2O3 * 2SiO2 * 2H2O, which is, to the extent of current knowledge, not found in nature; in nature, we are likely to find other trace elements, which would slightly upset the above formula (Rhodes, 2000, p. 28).</p>
<p>Secondary clays are the ones as described as being transported from their source rock<br>
and mixing with other elements. When silica and alumina are combined with other elements, from what is referred to as alkalies, and when all the clay particles are of the optimal ratios, they can be made pliable with the addition of water. They then can be formed into most any shape if manipulated accordingly. Water allows the clay particles to slide along each other like two flat pieces of glass that has a film of water separating them.</p>
<p>Along with the initial groupings of Primary and Secondary exists subgroups of the secondary clay category. These different types can each perform different functions, and, once again, sometimes different clays are mixed together to get a specific response. The following are some different types of clay and a brief description of some of their characteristics.</p>
<p>Ball Clays</p>
<p>The term “ball clay” originates from “an early English clay mining practice of rolling the highly plastic clay into balls weighing 30 to 50 pounds” (Hosterman, 1949, p. C8). Ball clay when damp has the ability to be pressed and made into shapes without cracking. It’s a secondary clay, in that it has been moved by wind or water from its source and settled elsewhere in a deposit, it often contains some organic material. According to Hosterman (1949) “quartz sand or silt and iron oxide minerals are virtually absent from the best grades of ball clay” (p. C8). It is “used in clay bodies to increase plasticity and in glazes to add alumina” and “fires to a grayish or buff color” (Speight, 2003, p.G-1). Its other uses in the ceramic industry include the making of pottery, dinnerware, stoneware, tiles and sanitary ware (Hosterman, 1949, p. C8).</p>
<p>Ball Clay is made up of crystalline kaolinite with small amounts of illite and/or smectite (Hosterman, 1949, p. C1). Illite is defined as “a group name for non-expanding, clay-sized, dioctahedral, micaceous minerals” (USGS). Smectite is defined as “a clay mineral which undergoes reversible expansion on absorbing water” (Lexico). Hosterman (1949) states that “ball clays require 40 and 65 percent water of plasticity to become workable” (p. C8). The most notable characteristics of ball clay include “its plasticity, toughness, high green strength and adhesion” (Hosterman, 1949, p. C8). After firing, ball clay becomes vitreous and dense and the temperatures it melts is between 1,670 and 1,760 degrees Celsius (Hosterman, 1949, p. C8). They are not used by themselves in pottery making due to their characteristic of excessive shrinkage (Rhodes, 2000, p. 68). In fact, ball clays have been known to have shrinkage “as high as 20 percent when fired to maturity” (Rhodes, 2000, p. 68). They are often used as an additive to other clays to achieve “increased plasticity and workability” (Rhodes, 2000, p. 68). If the intended outcome for the clay body color is white, then one should not add above 15 percent of ball clay as anything above that amount tends to turn the fired body “a grey, off-white, or buff color” (Rhodes, 2000, p.68). There are sources of ball clay in the United States, mainly in “Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Texas, California, and Maryland, with the largest and purest deposits in Tennessee and Kentucky” (Powell, 1995, p. 200).</p>
<p>Fire Clays</p>
<p>Fire clays are aptly named as their distinguishing characteristic is their ability to resist high temperatures more so than the other clay types. Clays that resist fusion or deformity up to around 1500 degrees Celsius can be referred to as a fire clay (Rhodes, 2000, p. 68). They are very useful in the making of fire brick and other parts used in “kilns, furnaces, boilers, and melting pots” (Rhodes, 2000, p. 68 &amp; 69). It can be added to stoneware bodies to help increase its refractoriness and enhance the roughness of the body texture (Rhodes, p.68 &amp; p.69).</p>
<p>Stoneware Clays</p>
<p>Stoneware is a secondary clay formed when one clay’s particles became mixed with clay particles of varying sizes which helps it hold its form (aka plasticity) because the clay particles have more surface contact with each other which is helpful in shaping an object. Iron, titanium, and potassium are fluxes in stoneware. It is important to note that iron and titanium may cause the clay to turn brown when fired. Stoneware can vary in its’ characteristic, depending on where it was harvested. Its’ fired color can vary from buff to brown depending on the iron and titanium content.  It is often used to make coffee mugs, dinner plates, pitchers and many other types of utilitarian wares.  Sometimes it can be used just as found without adding any other ingredients to it (Rhodes, 2000, p. 69). Depending on its composition it can be fired to maturity anywhere between cone 1 to cone 10. (Speight,2003, p.185)</p>
<p>Earthenware Clays</p>
<p>Earthenware clay is a porous secondary clay and is also referred to as a Low-Fire clay. It fires to mature temperatures of cone 010 to cone 1 (Speight, 2003, p. 184). According to Speight (2003), “natural low-fired earthenware varies in color from reddish to yellowish, depending on the amount of iron or lime it contains” (p. 184 &amp; 185). Most clay found in nature might be earthenware clay (Rhodes, 2000, p.69). It is commonly used for making sculpture, flower pots and bricks. (Rhodes, 2000 p.69) (Speight, 2003, p.185).</p>
<p>It’s important to learn some basics about the different kinds of clay, to be able to most effectively choose a material that will help us achieve our desired outcome.</p>
