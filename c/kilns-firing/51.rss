            <p>I have access to a wood fired soda kiln, based on Peg Udall’s design. We’ve fired several times and have trouble getting temp *10 on top.  It was built with what appear to be very large flue openings.  Is there any formula, rule of thumb for the size of flue opening?</p>

<p>Raku Firing</p>
<p>Raku is a very complicated and fascinating version of firing ceramics. Simply put, it is the method of removing bisque-fired ceramics from a kiln without letting them cool down and then moving them into some type of closed container with some material within it that will create a flammable atmosphere. The results vary widely, and will change from a variety of factors. Some of them are the amount of time it takes to move the piece from the raku kiln to the enclosed container, how long the piece sits in the enclosed container, the thickness of the glaze that is put on the piece, and the type of raku kiln being used. The results are a lot less reliable than traditional kiln firing, which makes the pieces much more unique. The history of raku firing, the many nuances in the processes and results, and the uniqueness of these pots are all facets of what makes raku firing such an interesting method of creating.</p>
<p>The history of raku firing is very long, and instances of it can be seen in different parts of the world. It was originally invented in 16thcentury Japan, in a province called Kyoto. The original raku pottery pieces were used in tea ceremonies and were considered to be extremely valuable, and they had an immense amount of meaning behind them. These traditional pots were used as Ceremonial Tea Ware of the Zen Buddhist Masters, and the word Raku signified enjoyment of freedom. The raku tea ceremony bowls incorporated Zen principles such as harmony, reverence, purity, and tranquility and both the process and specific results in their tea bowls incorporated an avoidance of luxury and a natural aesthetic that was greatly valued at the time and in their culture. These specific bowls were hand built, and the results from this artistic and spiritual process fit in with the Zen philosophy of Buddhism that inspired the invention of this amazing process. (Lavey.) The fact that these bowls were valued for their imperfections and asymmetry rather than those aspects being flaws is something that can be greatly admired about both the Zen philosophies that inspired these pots and the 16thcentury artists who continue to give inspiration to modern potters.</p>
<p>“According to the Zen Masters, its elusive, subtle, yet vigorous beauty is Raku’s only worth. It is valued because it is believed that the Spirit of the Maker is embodied in the form and revealed at the foot, which is traditionally left naked (unglazed). It is believed that if we are alert to ourselves, in contemplating the Raku form, we will recognize in it our own Spirit and Meaning. (Lavey.)”</p>
<p>This is the very beautiful and culturally rich origin of raku firing, and it has gone on to inspire ceramic artists all over the world for centuries to come. Artists often create to recognize their own personal meanings and embody some part of themselves into their preferred forms and methods of process, and around the world artists found different ways to preform raku firing and it reflected on their cultures just like it did from its origins. Raku firing can be a very personal and even spiritual experience, due to it being much more hands-on experience compared to other firing methods and the nature of the process and results.</p>
<p>The process of raku firing can vary from the traditional method of the pieces being removed from the kiln and then cooled at air temperature, to the most common contemporary method of removing the kiln before any cooling at all and moved into an airtight container with flammable material put inside of it beforehand which is commonly known as the more “Western” version. The flammable materials are most commonly sawdust or newspaper. This process starves the pot of oxygen, and the glazes react to this in very beautiful ways. The pots themselves are most often made from a stoneware clay, which tends to be a lighter color both in unfired and fired forms. The unglazed portions of the pots turn black through this firing process, due to the pot being starved from oxygen in this Western version where they are put into the airtight container. The container often is a metal trash can, but anything that is airtight and can safely contain the flammable materials will give the desired result of a reduction chamber that deprives the pot of oxygen which greatly influences the result of the finish, no matter what the glaze is. The lid has to be put on the airtight container very quickly to assure that the oxygen reduction happens at an ideal rate, and the amount of time taken to move the pot to whatever container it reduces in will affect the finish greatly. After the pot has cooled down, it is often cleaned because whatever the combustible material inside the reduction chamber usually leaves soot over the piece.</p>
<p>Due to this reduction process being somewhat aggressive and exposes the pieces to a great amount of shock, there is a relatively high rate of cracking or exploding. Another factor that can add to the higher likelihood of damage is the fact that the pot is moved during the firing, and has to be moved very quickly. In traditional firing methods, this is not an element that has to be considered since the pots sit in one place throughout the entire firing process.</p>
<p>Raku is a comparatively low-fire method compared to other traditional methods such as high-fire oxidation or reduction firings. Western raku is typically heated to around 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit which falls into the category of cone 06 which is considered low-fire. High-fire can go up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. Another difference is that traditional firing cycles can take up to 10 hours, with additional time added for the time it takes for the kiln to heat up and cool down enough to be able to take the ceramics out of the kiln safely. The pots must be taken out using tongs, gloves, and sometimes even a full protective outfit due to the risks of being burned. With raku firing, the firing cycle is very short: around 15 minutes to 1 hour in the kiln which is very unique for kiln firings.</p>
<p>The time spent after taking raku fired pots out of the kiln depends on whether it is done with the Eastern method or the Western method. The Eastern method often incorporates rapid cooling of the newly removed and still red-hot fired pieces in normal air temperatures or dipped or sprayed with water. The Western method is the one previously described where the pieces go through a post-firing reduction by being places in an enclosed container and starved of oxygen. (D’Souza.)</p>
<p>Another aspect of the raku process is that the kiln is heated much more quickly compared to other kiln firings, and this shock of heat combined with the shock of air temperature result in the unique appearance of raku pots having a heavily crazed or glossy surface. Whether or not the firing is done in the method where it is placed in the airtight enclosed container after being removed from the raku kiln, this shock of being taken out of the kiln still affects the pot. This process creates for a very unpredictable outcome which is one of the aspects that makes it so appealing to many potters.</p>
<p>Some of the more common contemporary raku finishes are a matte multi-colored finish, a high shine muti-colored finish, a white crackle finish, or the very interesting method of burned hair or feather finishes. Most glazes are suitable for raku firings, but there are specific glazes made for raku firings that take into account all of the different variables of the firing so they can produce more ideal results. Raku pots are usually not food safe, due to the risk of flaking on the pots and the nature of the resulting glaze finishes and they are also less durable than traditionally fired stoneware pieces due to being in the kiln for a dramatically shorter time period. Pots also have a more lightweight feel after being raku fired.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect that happens often with the multi-colored high shine and slightly metallic finish that is common in raku glazes is that after time passes, the color dulls due to oxidation. With the horsehair or feather method, the pot is taken out of the kiln and rather than being reduced in an airtight chamber such as in the Western method, it is left to be shocked by the air temperature and not reduced at all. These pots have no glaze on them at all, they are left bare and then burned with the horsehair or feathers while they are still hot. This process is very hands-on and produces some very interesting and beautiful results.</p>
<p>Raku firing is a very amazing process with a lot of science and history behind it. The history, process, and uniqueness of these pots are some of the many reasons that this method of firing is so prominent in the field of pottery. Learning about the rich history contributes to being able to participate in this process with added context and a wider outlook.</p>

            <p>Often, glaze recipes are intended for a specific firing atmosphere.  Glazes like Celadon and Copper Red require a <em>reduction atmosphere</em> in order to achieve the intended blue/green or red color for those glazes.  Other glazes like clears and whites might look the same whether they are fired in oxidation or reduction.</p>

    What are cones?
Firing ceramics in a kiln is a bit like cooking a pizza in the oven.  As with Italian wood-fired stoves, you could set your oven on very high heat and cook the pizza in just four minutes.  Or you could cook the pizza for a longer amount of time at lower heat.  Either way, you’ll end up with edible pizza. 
Pyrometric cones are a measurement of the total amount of heatwork.  Heatwork is the combination of time and temperature.  We can say that two pizzas received a similar amount o…

<p>Disclaimer/Warning:<br>
Automated kilns weren’t meant to be left completely unattended. I fire to a witness cone viewed through a spy hole, so I am there every time it hits peak. Others rely completely on the controller. If this is the case, you can try to  <em>Write your own Cone Fire</em>  program in order to smooth out some of the variables.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many are finding inconsistencies in their glaze results from one firing to the next. The variables are vast, but I’m going to focus on three reasons attributing to inconsistencies. The first is that the kiln elements decline with use. The second is that kiln loads vary in weight and how that weight is distributed from one firing to the next. The third is due to heavily insulated kilns that hold too much heatwork following the top end of the firing.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand, is that a cone measures heatwork, not just a given temperature. Heatwork is a measure of heat + time. Time refers to how long it takes to get to peak temperature, as well as any hold maintained once that peak is achieved.<br>
If the kiln is in good working order, it should have no problem achieving the desired rate of rise and peak temperature. But, if your elements aren’t new, or if the kiln is packed heavy, it could take longer than you programmed to get to the intended temperature. If your kiln achieves the programmed temperature over a longer period of time, over-firing will most likely result.</p>
<p>Example: ^10 (true 90 degree bend) equals 2342°F, only if the kiln can maintain a 108/hr rise during the last 150-200° prior to peak. If it takes longer, then the temperature you need to reach will be less. Again, both heat and time must be factored in.</p>
<p>To continue, I’ll need to use my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://www.hotkilns.com/">L&amp;L</a> Dynatrol (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://www.bartinst.com/KILN/v6cf.html">Bartlett V6-CF</a>) controller as reference.<br>
If you wish to write your own cone fire, program a  <em>Vary Fire</em>  schedule the same way as usual, except that when it asks for the peak temperature, push the  <em>Other</em>  button. Keep pushing  <em>Other</em>  until you see  <em>Cone</em> displayed. Type in the cone number you want to achieve (e.g., “10″). The controller will calculate the temperature to hit based upon your programmed rate of rise. Then, if your kiln lags during the firing, the controller will recalculate the temperature based upon the actual rate of rise.</p>
<p>For heavily insulated kilns yielding an over-fired cone, I’ve found that inputing a  <em>cone offset</em>  helps. Doing this can aid in compensating for the residual heatwork responsible for bending the cone beyond the point you want. Before you do this, you’ll need to monitor a firing to see how much to offset. Also, keep in mind that if your kiln is heavily packed, the ware will hold heat, accounting for inconsistencies as well.</p>
<p><strong>Inputing a Cone Offset</strong> : Before you begin inputing a program, hit the  <em>Other</em>  key until you see  <em>CnoS</em> displayed, then hit  <em>Enter</em> . Typing “90″ before the desired offset temperature will yield a lower actual temperature, decreasing the amount of heat work achieved. Again, the idea here is that the residual heatwork will bend the cone further (hopefully closer to perfection).</p>
<p>You can only offset the cone measurement by 50°F, but if you need to do more than this, contact the manufacturer, as it eludes to a larger problem. Offsetting in this way will only affect the cone you select. It will not affect your thermocouple readings during other  <em>Vary Fire</em>  or  <em>Cone Fire</em>  programs. Speaking of thermocouples, none of what I’ve said here will help, unless your thermocouples are reading accurately. See the post on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://jessehull.com/2007/12/23/cone-readings-kiln-control-calibrations/">Studio Kiln Thermocouple Calibrations</a> for more on this.<br>
After reading this, you may begin to understand why I always fire by a visual cone in achieving the correct level of final heatwork. Computers haven’t completely replaced humans yet for a reason! I also prefer a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://jessehull.com/kilns/ll-jd18-jh-electric-kiln/">kiln</a> that allows for a fast descent, largely eliminating the effects of residual heatwork.</p>

<p>Wednesday, February 6th, 2008</p>
<p>There are many good kilns available, but choosing one to suit your needs can be difficult. Take note that simply because a kiln boasts a “Rated to Cone 10″, “Energy Efficient” or “Heavy Insulation” label, it does not necessarily mean it is the best choice.  As a matter of fact, that last one can even cause you a good deal of grief.</p>
<p>I believe a good analogy to use toward an electric kiln, is that of a boat.  This may seem like an odd comparison at first; however, consider that both require power to operate against resistance, and since neither has brakes, it is up to the user to compensate for the dissipating momentum. This “momentum”, in the case of a kiln, translates to  <em>residual heatwork</em> .Firing a heavily insulated kiln then, is comparable to piloting a heavier and less agile boat –for even after a pyrometric cone achieves the desired bend, it can easily drop well past that perfect arch if your kiln releases heat too slowly.It is also important to realize that automated controllers don’t make this any easier to deal with. A controller can stop supplying power to the elements, but it cannot make a kiln cool any faster than it’s ability to release heat. The user still has to figure out how to compensate, and then program the controller accordingly.I believe the best way to get the kiln that is perfect for your firings is to either build it from scratch, or start with a commercially manufactured shell of the size needed. Whichever choice you go with, the options to consider adding should focus on the need for accuracy and account for the components that will wear out the fastest.The variables below are those that led to designing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://jessehull.com/kilns/ll-jd18-jh-electric-kiln/">the kiln I fire</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Variable 1</strong>  - The ability to heat:The kiln should  <strong>at least</strong>  have the ability to climb all the way to it’s top-rated temperature at 270°F/hr –without lagging. To accomplish this, the kiln needs enough power. I would suggest erring on the side of an “overpowered” design, for if your kiln lacks the ability to ramp fast when new, it will surely be difficult to reproduce results after the elements and other components age even slightly.The correct match between that power and the heating elements must also be calculated. Whether you go with standard or heavier gauge wire, it will have to be factored into a good watt density. As each kiln is going to be different, this subject gets much more involved than this post allows for, so I suggest speaking to a qualified individual (contacts I’ve had good experience with include: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://www.hotkilns.com/">L&amp;L</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://www.kilns.com/">Geil</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://www.skutt.com/index_dir.html">Skutt</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://www.euclids.com/">Euclid</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://www.kanthal.com/">Kanthal</a>).APM’s are often said to be the best choice for high temperature work. The long holds (”heat soaks”) used to grow the crystals in a glaze cause “grain growth” in standard element wire, thus weakening the metal. The thought is that since APM’s possess a different structure developed through a sintering process, they aren’t as susceptible to the damage produced by long holds at high temps.Having said this, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://jessehull.com/kilns/ll-jd18-jh-electric-kiln/">my kiln</a> currently runs with longer lengths of 12 gauge Kanthal A1 elements. This wire has proven more resistant than thinner gauges to the effects of higher temperatures, as well as the chemical attack occurring from clay and glaze during the firing. These elements currently have over 60 ^11-12 crystalline firings on them, show no visible signs of degradation, and perform with the same efficiency as they did when they were new.-Also, A-1 wire is about 1/3 the price of APM. Beyond power and a good watt-density, the kiln will need  <em>adequate</em>  insulating properties to retain the heat. Notice that I chose the word “adequate”…</p>
<p><strong>Variable 2</strong>  - The ability to cool:Heavily insulated kilns heat well, because they  <em>hold</em>  heat well. This fact is often used to qualify them as “efficient”. But such a kiln’s Achilles’ heel resides in the inability to release heat at higher temperatures. I do understand that this goes against the current industrial tendency to add more and more insulation, but I hold that the value in a kiln that allows for a rapid diminishing of heatwork after achieving the desired cone value is  <em>extremely</em>  underrated.In 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://jessehull.com/links/">Diane Creber</a> passed on to me a wonderful collection of literature on crystalline glazes, including some of David Snair’s notes &amp; letters. This information, along with my own correspondence with Derek Clarkson and others, showed a common preference in using small, high-powered kilns capable of completing the first and second phase of the firing (the climb to peak  <strong>&amp; descent to the first hold</strong> ) in a short time frame. This, in my mind is a truer example of “efficiency”. I have fired several types of clay and glaze in kilns of various sizes, and there’s nothing like relying on a kiln capable of completing the entire firing program as it is actually set by the user.Many of the more spectacular glazes I’ve worked with require a very accurate firing. With crystallines in particular, my goal is to heat the glaze well past its melting point, possibly maintain a hold to dissolve silica, zinc, and excessive nuclei, then quickly halt run-off by descending into the next ramp. As all of this must occur within a very small window of time, excessive residual heatwork is the last thing you want. <strong>Variable 3</strong>  - Structural Integrity at High Temperatures:It seems obvious to choose kiln parts that are designed for the temperature and type of firings intended. But this is something that is overlooked often enough.At it’s core, a kiln is simply a strategic stack of insulating firebrick. These bricks, cut to fit and usually wrapped in a metal skin, make up “the kiln shell”.K23 brick is the current standard for most hobby/studio kilns. If you are only going to ^6-^8, then it’s a suitable choice; however, both ^9 &amp; ^10 (as high as 2381°F, depending on your rate of rise), occur at or beyond the recommended range of k23. The  <em>hotface</em> , or the side of the brick exposed to the interior of the kiln, can shrink and crack if exposed to temperatures beyond the rating (e.g., k23≈2300°F). Keep in mind that this will occur even if you are only firing that hot occasionally, or if you are firing to a slightly lower temperature and holding there to achieve the equivalent level of heatwork.In designing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://jessehull.com/kilns/ll-jd18-jh-electric-kiln/">my own kiln</a>, I selected k25 brick, because I like the option of firing hot… often bending ^11-12.My firings show four important benefits with regard to K25:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The k25 brick is less fragile than k23.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The k25 brick performs extremely well from 2000°F to peak without deforming…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…it then allows for fast cooling from the top temperature down to 2250°F.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It still, however, releases heat slower through the middle to lower phases (1500-500°F), when dunting and crazing typically occur.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Variable 4</strong>  - Accuracy:Along the same line of using brick rated to your needs, consider the ill-advised use of Type-K thermocouples (rated only to ≈2200°F), which still come as standard equipment in many high-fire kiln models. The option of using protective sheaths on Type-K’s can create a lag in temperature readings. My suggestion is to always go with a thinly sheathed Type-S thermocouple for any firings above^6.Refer to the post on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://jessehull.com/2007/12/23/cone-readings-kiln-control-calibrations/">Studio Kiln Thermoucouple Calibrations</a>.If you’re replacing a kiln of roughly the same size, go with your notes on how that kiln fired –both up and down. Did one section typically lag behind during the ascent and/or descent? Now would be the time to add insulation to that particular section, or to the floor or lid. Remember to start with the least amount you need however, and add more only where it’s necessary… otherwise, you’ll be right back in the same (big) boat, so to speak. <strong>Variable 5</strong> -Efficiency &amp; Energy Consumption:An argument against building a kiln as described here, is that the result  <em>seems</em>  under-insulated, and to require more power.  It may therefore appearing inefficient by modern standards.What I am focusing on here, is a small to medium sized kiln meant for studio use, when reproducing accurate levels of heatwork is important. If your goal is to run several large kilns on a daily or weekly basis, and you are firing glazes with a wider heatwork tolerance, then the few dollars you save per firing is certainly a significant consideration.On that note, and to qualify my view toward energy efficiency, I refer you to the relevant post on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://jessehull.com/2008/02/03/electric-kiln-actual-energy-consumption/"> <strong>the actual power consumption of an electric kiln</strong> </a>. <strong>Related Links:</strong>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053743/http://jessehull.com/kilns/ll-jd18-jh-electric-kiln/">New L&amp;L JD18-JH</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110203065842/http://jessehull.com">Note: This article is from Jesse Wiseman Hull’s website, now archived here.</a></p>
<p>Sunday, December 23rd, 2007</p>
<p>Whether you’re trying to achieve an accurate firing via a peak temperature hold or a calculated ramp, it’s a good idea to calibrate your thermocouples (TC’s) before relying on the factory setting in your controller.</p>
<p>Hopefully you have Type S TC’s … if so, you’re not going to need to calibrate them again for some time. It’s pretty ridiculous that Type K’s are used past 2100°F these days. If you have them and plan to go beyond that temperature, you’ll need to check and adjust for “drift” about every 5-10 firings.<br>
No matter which TC’s are being used however, I always suggest using witness cones to judge accuracy on each firing.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two ways to calibrate your thermocouples. One way is to fire your kiln, inspect the cones afterwards, and then make a guess as to how to offset your TC’s. This can take anywhere from a few to several firings.   I hear of many who do it this way, and honestly- I’ve never understood why.</p>
<p>A more effective approach is to record what your kiln controller reads during a firing, when you see the cone achieving that perfect bend, then establish the offset from there.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1-</strong>  Check with your manufacturer to see what the factory TC offset for your kiln/controller should be set at, then verify that each TC is offset to the number they give you.</p>
<p><em>Example</em> : L&amp;L Kiln’s factory offset is usually 18 (not zero),<br>
when using the Bartlett V6-CF control board &amp; Type S TC’s.</p>
<p><strong>2-</strong>  Stack your kiln with stilts and shelves so that an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100612225725/http://www.ortonceramic.com/pyrometrics/arts/cones.shtml">Orton self-supporting witness cone</a> can be viewed through each spy, and place another in the center of each shelf. I also put in glaze tests in addition to cones to get as much information as possible. I prefer not to fire a “light” kiln, as the loss in thermal mass could prevent an accurate result, so I use softbrick and/or extra stilts to take up the empty space.</p>
<p><strong>3-</strong>  Program the controller for a rise of 108°F/hr during the last 150F prior to peak.</p>
<p><em>Example</em> : ^10 = 2345°F at 108°F/hr.<br>
So program a rise of 108°F/hr from 2145°F to 2345°F.</p>
<p><strong>4-</strong>  Set a delay if needed so that you can be there around the time the kiln reaches peak. …Obviously, you’ll want to err on being early.</p>
<p><strong>5-</strong>  Record the temperature of each TC at the time the corresponding cone bends perfectly. Understand that the readings may be different for each zone/TC, and that they can be offset independently.<br>
<strong>The perfect arch (90°</strong>  <strong>bend) for a self-supporting Orton cone is when the tip is level with the top of the triangular base.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6-</strong>  From here you can figure out if your kiln is under or over firing, and by how much.</p>
<p><strong>7-</strong>  Your controller can be programmed to offset the TC readings by as much as 50° in either direction. To adjust the TC offset on a Bartlett V6-CF, you will need to calculate the number to offset (also refer to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100612225725/http://www.bartinst.com/KILN/V6CF%20700/v6cfoverview700.html">Bartlett’s online manual</a>):</p>
<p><strong>To  <em>lower</em>  the temperature/heat work</strong>  in the kiln, start with the factory set point and add the number of degrees to compensate  <em>for each thermocouple</em> . This will raise the temperature displayed.</p>
<p><strong>To raise the temperature/heat work</strong>  in the kiln, start with the factory set point and subtract the number of degrees to compensate  <em>for each thermocouple</em> . This will lower the temperature displayed.<br>
To program a number below zero: type in “90″, immediately followed by the number of degrees to compensate… think of the 90 as a (-).<br>
Consider that since 18 is the factory set point for an L&amp;L with Type S TC’s, you should not need to go below zero. If you find that you do, I would suggest contacting the manufacturer of your kiln or controller.</p>
<hr>
<p>After going through this process with my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100612225725/http://jessehull.com/kilns/ll-jd18-jh-electric-kiln/">new kiln</a>, I found that my top TC needed an offset of 19 and my bottom at 25. Leaving it at the factory setting of 18 would have resulted not only in over firing, but also in uneven heatwork between the zones (sections) of the kiln. Go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100612225725/http://jessehull.com/2007/12/20/170/">here</a> for more on this.</p>

          <title>Measuring Heatwork &amp; Temperature with Orton Cones</title>

            <h2>What are cones?</h2>
<p>Firing ceramics in a kiln is a bit like cooking a pizza in the oven.  As with Italian wood-fired stoves, you could set your oven on very high heat and cook the pizza in just four minutes.  Or you could cook the pizza for a longer amount of time at lower heat.  Either way, you’ll end up with edible pizza.</p>
<p>Pyrometric cones are a measurement of the total amount of <em>heatwork</em>.  <em>Heatwork</em> is the combination of time <em>and</em> temperature.  We can say that two pizzas received a similar amount of heatwork if they are both fully cooked, even if they were cooked at different temperatures for different durations of time.  Similarly, we can say that two ceramic vases were fired to a certain <em>cone</em> (e.g. similar amount of heatwork) even if the firings were different in temperature &amp; time.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that firings are often <em>uneven</em>: a kiln may have cool and hot spots, and the difference in temperature may be one or more cones.  Just because a cone has fallen doesn’t mean the entire kiln (including the ceramics and kiln furniture) has also reached that cone temperature.  So it’s a good idea to sometimes place extra cones throughout the kiln to determine if the firing is even.</p>
<p>For more information on cones, see the excellent Digitalfire article<br>
<a href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/education/interpreting_orton_cones_193.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Interpreting Orton Cones</a> as well as Orton’s <a href="https://www.ortonceramic.com/Resources/Pyrometric_Cones/" rel="nofollow noopener">Pyrometric Cones Resources</a>.</p>
<h2>Setting &amp; Reading Cones</h2>
<p><em>The quantity of cones and cone packs as well as their arrangement and placement vary from potter to potter, kiln to kiln. The following is only one approach.</em></p>

<p>There are a number of different cone manufacturers. Each brand has unique cone formulations and firing characteristics. Cone numbers between brands may be quite different, for instance the Chinese “Seger” cone 9 is approximately Orton cone 12. Even when cone numbers between brands are rated for the same temperature, actual firing behaviour may be quite different. Glazy recommends using Orton cones as they seem to be the most reliable and accurate.</p>

<em>Length of large cones above cone plaque.</em><p></p>
<p>According to Orton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Large Cones are normally mounted so exactly 2” of the cone is exposed above the top of the cone plaque or clay pat. Small Cones are mounted so that 15/16" of the cone is exposed above the top of the plaque or pat."</p>

<em>Wet cone packs can explode.  Make your packs in advance or poke holes into the pack to let steam to escape.</em><p></p>
<p>This cone pack is for an Orton cone 10 firing.</p>
<p>The <em>guide</em> cone 9 will alert us when we are close to temperature.<br>
The <em>guard</em> cone 11 will let us know if we are beginning to overfire.</p>
<p>While more expensive, pre-made cone plaques and self-supporting cones eliminate height and angle inconsistencies.</p>

<em>Viewing low-temperature cones in the kiln at about 900°C. Cone 010 is bending, while 08, 1, and 3 have not moved. It’s advisable to place cone packs at the top and bottom of your kiln in order to understand and control temperature differences while firing.</em><p></p>

<em>A cone pack after firing. In this firing, once cone 9 fell to 5 o’clock the kiln was intentionally stalled. Even though the temperature did not rise, cone 10 completely fell after about one hour.

<em>Inexpensive Chinese cones.  Cones 7 and 9 are down, but cone 8 is still standing. The entire box of cones should be thrown away.  But which cone is defective, 8 or 9? Compared to the cost of a firing and the work inside, the cost of cones is negligible. Buy the most reliable cones you can find.</em><p></p>

<h2>Viewing Cones</h2>
<p><em>Warning: Prolonged or cumulative long-term exposure to infrared and ultraviolet light can seriously damage your eyes.</em></p>
<p>ANSI-compliant infrared and ultraviolet eye-protection glasses are a must when viewing<br>
inside the kiln at high temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>Sunglasses that only filter ultraviolet light are NOT sufficient.</strong></p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://ceramicartsdaily.org/uncategorized/eye-protection-in-the-pottery-studio/" rel="nofollow noopener">Eye Protection in the Pottery Studio</a></p>
<p>There are many tricks for seeing cones more clearly inside the kiln.</p>
<p>The simplest method is using a high-intensity LED flashlight with an output of at least 400 lumens and a focused beam.</p>

<p>In my experience firing digitally controlled electric kilns, the programmed firing profile is purely theoretical fluff sometimes with very little relationship to the reality of actual kiln performance. Leaving aside the notion that it only can be stated with any assurance that it was cone-whatever if you had a set of actual witness cones in there, what you thought you were telling the kiln to do through the programming instructions was probably not what the kiln actually did, because it wasn’t capable of doing what you told it.</p>
<p>When I am trying to document a particular kiln’s actual performance, I have handheld logging pyrometer connected to a computer which records the actual temperature every minute in a spreadsheet for later analysis. Attached is an example of a firing in a kiln that was performing badly. The yellow and red lines are what the kiln was programmed to do; the purple line is what actually happened.</p>

<h2>When can I open the kiln?</h2>
<p>It’s not unusual to feel impatient while waiting for a kiln to cool!  But ideally you should wait until the kiln reaches near room temperature.  Otherwise you can try the burning paper test listed below.  Your kiln should definitely be below 400F/200C before opening.</p>
<p><em>Arnold Howard, Paragon Industries, via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel that you should leave the kiln closed until it reaches room temperature. Ill add, though, that opening the kiln while its still hot wont hurt the kiln. (But it may damage the ware.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Ivor Lewis via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rapid cooling can damage of some forms of refractory lining shortening the life of your kiln. My suggestion, dont open a kiln until you are sure you can hold the pots in your bare hands, not glove, just with your skin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Linda Arbuckle via Ceramic Recipes:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read Frank and Janet Hamer’s book “The Potters Dictionary” on cristobalite. It’s sort of a cousin to quartz alpha-to-beta phase at 1000 degrees. Cristobalite forms from free silica in the body around cone 03, gets 2% bigger, then inverts upon cooling at around the temperature paper burns (Fahrenheit 451 - if anyone remembers the Ray Bradbury story). Actually just a bit lower. The change in size is more abrupt than quartz inversion, and a lot of cristobalite, inverting suddenly and unevenly, can cause dunting. Just a bit is good - puts the glaze under compression and counters crazing. But, the bottom line… if you put paper in the peep and it browns or bursts into flame, you shouldn’t be exposing your work to heat shock yet because you’re above cristobalite inversion. You can also crack work re-firing if you pass through this threshold unevenly. More of a problem for people working at mid-range and highfire than lowfire wares.<br>

<h2>Estimating Cooling Time</h2>
<p><em>Andy Rawson via Ceramic Recipes</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you would like a rough estimate of when you can open the kiln you can use this exponential decay calculator.<br>
<a href="http://www.miniwebtool.com/exponential-decay-calculator/?n1=532&amp;n2=.18&amp;n3=&amp;n4=200" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.miniwebtool.com/exponential-decay-calculator/?n1=532&amp;n2=.18&amp;n3=&amp;n4=200</a><br>
Put the current temperature of the kiln in the “initial amount”<br>
A decay rate of “.18” works well for most standard electric kilns.<br>
Leave the time empty then put the target opening temperature in the “final amount” field then hit calculate.<br>
Down below it will solve for time in hours to reach the final temperature. Works well for me to tell the wife when we can open the kiln so she stops asking every ten minutes</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Exponential decay</a></h3>

<p>A quantity is subject to exponential decay if it decreases at a rate proportional to its current value.  Symbolically, this process can be expressed by the following differential equation, where N is the quantity and λ (lambda) is a positive rate called the exponential decay constant:
 The solution to this equation (see derivation below) is:
 where N(t) is the quantity at time t, and N0 = N(0) is the initial quantity, i.e. the quantity at time t = 0.
 If the decaying quantity, N(t), is the number...</p>
