<p>Science for Potters, by Linda Bloomfield, covers those aspects of science that are useful to potters and that help to give a deeper understanding of ceramic materials and processes. By gaining a deeper understanding of materials, their structure, composition, origins, and how they interact, potters can have greater control over and new insights into their craft.</p>
<p>Many people think that science is a subject that is at the opposite end of the spectrum from art. But ceramic artists know that ceramics IS science as much as it is art. Trouble is, science is a subject that doesn’t come easily for some. That’s why Linda Bloomfield, who was trained as a scientist before becoming a potter, wrote  <em>Science for Potters</em> .</p>
<h3>You’ll learn about:</h3>
<ul>
<li>the basics of chemistry in clear and simple terms</li>
<li>how the chemistry and structure of clay bodies affects their working properties</li>
<li>what makes a stable glaze</li>
<li>how materials interact in a glaze</li>
<li>glaze faults and how to correct them</li>
<li>substitutions for glaze materials that are no longer available</li>
<li>the glaze unity molecular formula and why it’s so important</li>
</ul>
<h3>The basics and beyond!</h3>
<p>Beginning with the basics, Linda covers the structure of the atom, how atoms combine to make compounds, and why some compounds can be used to make colored pigments and glazes. You’ll discover how things like the Moh’s Scale of Hardness can help you formulate scratch-resistant glazes or how the Periodic Table of the Elements pertains specifically to ceramics.</p>
<h3>Geology and the potter!</h3>
<p>Linda focuses on the aspects of geology, chemistry, and materials science that are relevant to potters. The properties of clays are explained by examining their chemistry and structure, and the various rocks and minerals used in glaze making are explored. By understanding how the structure of different clays affects their working properties, potters can select clays appropriate to the forming and firing methods they choose to use.</p>
<h3>Glazing and Firing</h3>
<p>Making sure your glaze fits your clay body is something that cannot be ignored by the potter, and a chapter is dedicated to glaze fit. Within that chapter, Bloomfield explains glaze faults and how to correct the. She also includes an exceptionally clear explanation of the changes that clay goes through during firing to become ceramic. The deeper understanding of materials, their structure, composition, origins, and how they interact will give potters greater control over and new insights into their craft.</p>
<h3>Appendixes</h3>
<p>Useful appendixes include a glossary, ceramic materials list, Orton Cone Chart, Phase Diagram for Silica-Almina-Calcia, materials analysis charts for both US and UK frits, clays and feldspars, a complete Periodic Table of the Elements and an index.</p>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Linda Bloomfield was born in Ithaca, New York. She grew up in England and studied engineering at Warwick University, with a year at MIT during her PhD studies. She spent a year in Tsukuba, Japan, working for NEC (Nippon Electric Company), then returned to London to work as a researcher at Imperial College. She started her pottery career while living in California, where she became familiar with US potters’ materials. She now lives in London where she makes porcelain tableware, teaches glaze courses, and writes pottery books.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>While many of Joseph Grebanier’s results seem to be quite different from the original Song glazes, this book offers an interesting account of how a ceramicist can use locally-sourced materials and UMF analyses to develop glazes.  Also includes chapters on glaze calculation and how to make your own ball mill.  <em>- Derek</em></p>
<p>Joseph Grebanier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book offers a detailed account of the procedures I have developed over a period of many years in the making of stoneware glazes belonging to several different families of Chinese ceramics, especially those of the Sung era.</p>

          <title>Chinese Glazes by Nigel Wood</title>

            <p><strong>Publisher’s Description</strong><br>
Chinese glazes have been admired throughout history for their extraordinary qualities and colors—not least in China itself, where their appearance has been compared variously to jade, to tea-dust, to hare’s fur, or to the “color of the sky after the rain.” Some Chinese glazes are vibrant and brilliant in tone, while others are deep, complex, and subtle, their properties seeming to change according to ambient light. Chinese glazes have long presented a technical challenge to Western potters, and this book is the most complete account yet of their nature and their reconstruction. The story of Chinese glazes is also the story of Chinese ceramics itself, one of the most fascinating and influential traditions in ceramic history.</p>
<p>Chinese Glazes traces the development of China’s great high-fired glaze tradition from its roots in the Bronze Age, through the famous monochrome stoneware glazes of the Song dynasty, to the fine porcelain glazes of southern China. The book also examines in detail the story of China’s low-fired glazes, from the time of China’s first emperor to the present day. The book shows clearly how the potters of ancient China were able to work their ceramic miracles from the simplest recipes, and how modern potters can use and adapt these principles for their own work. The book contains hundreds of recipes for formulating Chinese glazes with Western materials, simple and advanced calculation techniques, as well as efficient blending procedures with local materials.</p>
<p>The book is lavishly illustrated, with nearly three hundred photographs, one hundred in full color. These depict examples of the Chinese arts as found in pottery ranging from simple earthenware jars excavated at Neolithic sites to exquisitely designed dishes found in imperial tombs. They also show examples of modern Western ware that employ these remarkable glazing techniques.</p>

          <title>The Complete Guide to Mid-Range Glazes by John Britt</title>

            <blockquote>
<p>According to Ceramics Monthly, approximately 75% of potters glaze their pieces at mid-range temperatures—and this complete studio guide eliminates the guesswork from the popular process. Along with over 400 hundred recipes, it explores mixing, application, specific firing and cooling cycles, and all the factors that make glazes work. See how to boost colors with intense stains, washes, and underglazes; achieve stunning results that equal high-fire glazing, and expand the frontiers of mid-range with tips for wood, salt, and soda firing.</p>
