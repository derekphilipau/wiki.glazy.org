            <h2>Does your glaze contain Zinc Oxide?</h2>
<p>Dick White via Ceramic Recipes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue is that zinc oxide absorbs moisture from the air if it is not in a completely sealed container. That plumps up the grains and they stick together in those hard granules. You can also calcine it to 8-900F (450C) to dry it out and then grind it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have found that once in the slurry, a blender just swirls it around without breaking the lumps. I don’t think it would work to “blend” it dry, but haven’t actually tried that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>If you calcine it, how does that affect the weight?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As it stands, the zinc oxide weighs more than it should because of the absorbed water, so you are putting less zinc into the recipe (and even less because you can’t get it through the sieve). Calcining it will return it to its proper molecular weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike Mangion via Ceramic Recipes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m in agreeance with Dick, calcining it to around 840F (450C) will help the process of breaking it apart with either a mortar &amp; pestle, grinder or in a ball mill. I understand your pain given all my glazes (Macro crystalline) use around 25% Zinc oxide.<br>
You also will be best to make a calcining pot and a big cookie jar (just bisque fired) for storing Zinc and other calcined materials, plus materials that can absorb moisture and clump over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Was your glaze properly sieved and mixed?</h2>
<p>Glazes with a lot of clay should be sieved at least twice through at least 80-mesh screens and mixed after each pass through the sieve.  In glazes that are not thoroughly mixed, the clays can still bunch together in small lumps, ruining the glaze surface.<br>

<h2>Was your glaze properly stirred before application?</h2>
<p>All glazes should be gently stirred to eliminate all clumps before application.</p>

          <title>Glaze Dunting in Lithium Glazes</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[wheath]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Glaze Faults</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This pot has been crushed by the thick lithium fluxed glaze and has dunted (cracked)…there is a different non-lithium glaze inside…I believe it is a good example of how lithium fluxed glaze can behave.<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/9055cee7e383ded8f68bb97e542724d937db8584.jpg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/9055cee7e383ded8f68bb97e542724d937db8584" title="18320614_10154797563863822_1414514723312696955_o.jpg"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/9055cee7e383ded8f68bb97e542724d937db8584_2_690x634.jpg" width="690" height="634" srcset="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/9055cee7e383ded8f68bb97e542724d937db8584_2_690x634.jpg, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/9055cee7e383ded8f68bb97e542724d937db8584_2_1035x951.jpg 1.5x, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/9055cee7e383ded8f68bb97e542724d937db8584_2_1380x1268.jpg 2x" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/9055cee7e383ded8f68bb97e542724d937db8584_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Lithium fluxed silica melts and expands at quartz inversion from alpha quartz to beta quartz (expanded), once the glaze matures, starts to cool, when it goes back through quartz inversion, the lithium fluxed quartz does not covert back to alpha quartz (does not contract)…that means the glass stays bigger than other non-lithium glazes…depending on the COE of the clay body, it can destroy the integrity of the body…only happens with lithium.</p>
<p>I have used the same glaze inside and outside on a well vitrified body, and it only crazed</p>
<p>Same glaze inside and out, on Standard 266, soft cone six…glaze fired two years ago, still rings like a bell.  btw, I used Australian spodumene in the glaze pictured, I have a Foote spodumene version that turns out darker<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/fc2b73130cfb1682d62c80399bd84b5502443715.jpg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/fc2b73130cfb1682d62c80399bd84b5502443715" title="18238650_10154797626448822_8420748998202874488_o.jpg"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/fc2b73130cfb1682d62c80399bd84b5502443715.jpg" width="690" height="566" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/fc2b73130cfb1682d62c80399bd84b5502443715_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>The first glaze problem I ever tackled was this lithium thing, it was pre-internet, so it was hard to get good information…this is the sort of pursuit that leads us to learn more about materials and how they behave</p>
<p>This the teapot that caused me to study lithium…it’s cone ten reduction porcelain…the first glaze firing the large flat foot dunted…so I put some more of the same spodumene glaze inside and fired it again…it dunted with another crack perpendicular to the first crack…that guided me to find out why<br>

            <h2>What is Glaze Crazing?</h2>
<p>Example of a glaze crazing on the inside of a bowl.<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/1d160227442205df63320fb9436c2aa51a2a89b5.jpg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/1d160227442205df63320fb9436c2aa51a2a89b5" title="Lee Love&amp;#39;s favorite Mackenzie Shino tea bowl."><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/1d160227442205df63320fb9436c2aa51a2a89b5.jpg" width="690" height="517" title="Lee Love's favorite Mackenzie Shino tea bowl." data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/1d160227442205df63320fb9436c2aa51a2a89b5_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>

<p><a href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_crazing.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_crazing.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fired glaze exhibits a network of fine cracks. These may be plainly visible after firing or may need enhancement with ink. Crazing may also appear after a period of time or after ware has been exposed to thermal shock. Fired strength (an thus functional ware quality) are directly related to crazing since ware strength is enhanced by having the glaze under slight compression whereas it is severely reduced (up to four times less) when the glaze is under tension. If the underlying clay matrix is porous and soaks up water then safety could be a concern with crazed ware since the cracks could be wide enough to provide a friendly breeding ground for colonies of bacteria. Containers used to store food are a special concern since a small colony in a crack can become a large culture in the food. If you have any doubt whether this is an important issue ask a commercial food service inspector about the subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Reducing or eliminating crazing</h2>
<p><a href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/troubleshooting/ceramic_troubleshooting_glaze_crazing.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://digitalfire.com/4sight/troubleshooting/ceramic_troubleshooting_glaze_crazing.html</a></p>
<h2>Crazing and ceramic strength</h2>
<p>Dave Finkelnburg via Clayart</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vince and John Hesselberth have touched on what, to me, is the important point about crazing…it weakens the ware. To me, any health concern is totally subjective in mid to high-fired ware. Its significance is up to you to judge. Strength, however, is a major, and clear cut issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Testing has shown that crazed ceramics are 75 to 80% WEAKER than the same ceramics uncrazed. So, if you are making cups, bowls, plates or other ceramics subject to being bumped and bounced and eventually chipped and broken, glazing them with glazes that neither craze nor shiver can make that work dramatically more durable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This doesnt mean crazed pots are doomed. Of course not! There are crazed pots that have survived for millenia. I just think if you are concerned about the durability of your work, and dont have specific, artistic reasons for introducing crazing into your work, you should consider crazing from a ceramic strength perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Are crazed glazes “food safe”?</h2>
<p>Donna Kat via Ceramic Recipes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Food safe is not a defined term. I have had people offer hypothesis on why crazed pieces are not suitable for a food surface. I have never had any supported evidence offered for that belief.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One microbiologist told me that unless you are keeping the clay saturated with moisture, it is not an environment where fungus or bacteria would grow. Most people, except for teenagers, I know wash their pottery after eating and do not leave it laying about in a state that would encourage the growth of unwanted organisms. Another microbiologist passionately argues against what the first microbiologist claims. However she offered no data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Related to that but on a different issue, Tim See has shown microscopic pictures of pieces where people fired glass shards in pottery classes. Those pictures were sufficient to convince me that putting glass in pottery for food is not a good idea. You can see shards of glass breaking away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eric Newman via Ceramic Recipes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ‘issue’ is that a crazed glaze may (I repeat MAY) have higher leaching issues if the glaze already is unstable since there are more edges from which to release possibly problematic chemicals. Anecdotally, I have used a non-vitrified bowl with a crazed clear glaze inside for 40 years and suffered no ill effects (but always have to use a placemat :-)), and I hand wash so it isn’t even getting that super-hot dishwasher cleaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prickly Potter via Ceramic Recipes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will also extend my point further and claim that these routine discussions (both about leaching chemicals and about crazing, neither of which is an issue if you don’t use lead, arsenic, or cadmium) contribute to a false perception that ceramics, in particular handmade, are dodgy and unsafe to use. I think historically it started with lead and the use of really dangerous chemicals that the vast majority of us no longer use or even have access to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tim See via Ceramic Recipes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facts food can get into crazing.<br>
Fact bacteria and viruses can also get into crazing.<br>
Fact when washing your dishes you are not as clean as you think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lee Love via Ceramic Recipes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I fought along side John Britt many years on Clayart against the “Glaze Nazis” (related to Seinfeld’s Soup Nazi, not the German WWII ones) for a more realistic view of glazes in the ceramic world. I have no patience with folks misinforming people about glazes, especially when they are doing it to sell their book.<br>
Some pots are supposed to be treated in different ways. For example: You don’t put a silk kimono in the washing machine. It is the same with pottery. Safety is primarily in the knowledge and education of the user. If your potter is well educated, your relationship with him or her includes the sharing of their knowledge, so you can be better informed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I make raku tea bowls for tea ceremony. No, they should not go in the microwave or the dishwasher. I don’t use lead glazes, but lead glazes are used in raku in Japan safely (Don’t drink orange juice from them!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ceramics Monthly Technofile, November 2018: “Dirty Dishes”, by Ryan Coppage, with Ruhan Farsin and Laura Runyen-Janecky.</p>
<p>Two glazes were compared, one which crazed, and one which didn’t. Samples of each were innoculated with bacteria, left to grow for 24 hours, and then subjected to one of a series of increasingly stringent cleaning methods, from simply wiping the tile with a paper towel, to washing with soap in a dishwasher at 75C / 167F. The crazed glaze retained some bacteria after all but the most stringent cleaning method, and the uncrazed glaze only retained bacteria after applying the least stringent cleaning method.</p>

<h2>Testing for glaze crazing &amp; leaching</h2>
<p><em>Peter Løgstrup Fischer via Ceramic Recipes:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My glazes get coffee tested before I use them for kitchenware. I place my glaze samples or tiles in a bowl, brew a strong <img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/images/emoji/twitter/muscle.png?v=9" title=":muscle:" class="emoji" alt=":muscle:"> pot of coffee, pour it over the samples so they are covered half way up and leave them in there for two nights. Samples that has any change to color or surface or spots that can’t be easily washed off, need further development.<br>
I run a similar test using vinegar.<br>

            <p><strong>What is Glaze Crawling?</strong></p>
<p>Taken from Digitalfire website, should be replaced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crawling is where the molten glaze withdraws into ‘islands’ leaving bare clay patches. The edges of the islands are thickened and smoothly rounded. In moderate cases there are only a few bare patches of clay, in severe cases the glaze forms beads on the clay surface and drips off onto the shelf. The problem is by far most prevalent where bisque-applied glazes contain excessive plastic clay content or are applied thickly or in multiple layers. It is also common in once-fire ware where it is more difficult to achieve a good bond with the body surface.</p>

            <p><strong>This is a Wiki-style entry, you can edit it!</strong></p>
<h2>What is Pinholing?</h2>
<p>‘Pinholes’ are small holes in the fired glaze surface possibly penetrating down to the body below. ‘Pits’ are smaller, they mar the surface of the glaze. Pinholes or pits are often no larger than the head of a pin but can very in size. During the firing, air pockets are trapped in the melting process.These pockets form bubbles in the glaze that can swell until the break the surface.  The causes of pinholes is still understudy, and is not clearly defined. Work done by David Finklnburg (MS Thesis, Alfred University 2006) postulates that the air of negative space in an applied glaze (aka Pore Space Vapor) is the source of the bubbles/pinholes. As the air is trapped by the melting of the glaze, which forms into bubbles which can swell and pop as the glaze melts.</p>
<h2>Pinholes vs. Pits</h2>
<p>David Finkelnburg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pinhole is a glaze fault extending after firing from the clay body to the glaze surface. Any hole from the surface not reaching the body is simply a pit. Both may be caused by a gas bubble within the molten glaze bursting at the glaze surface. “The cause…” I’m not sure that’s what I postulated, more like pore space CAN be a cause. I’m pretty certain there’s more than one cause. If pore space is a source, burnishing reduces pore spaces directly under the glaze. On the other hand, trimming a groggy body has the opposite effect, and in my observation seems to promote pinholes.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Possible Solutions to Pinholing</h2>
<p><strong>BURNISHING</strong><br>
Some have noted that burnishing the clay after trimming helps to reduce pinholing.  This burnishing can be done by simply sponging the pot on a wheel when dry, or sponging after trimming and then burnishing the pot.<br>
<img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/f2bbc3dc845f8d49eb8499a95defc8a8eb854b65.jpg" height="300" title="Sponging the pot after trimming"><br>

<hr>
<p><strong>TERRA SIGELLATA</strong><br>
At low temperatures, cone 06 to perhaps cone 01 some potters dip trimmed areas in terra sigellata. This accomplishes two things. It partially seals the foot slowing moisture absorption, and it cuts down pinhole over the trimmed areas. Pinholes on lowfired ware are especially problematic in majolica glazes.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>HIGHER BISQUE TEMP</strong><br>
It’s suggested that bisque to a higher temperature in a clean oxidation atmosphere helps reduce pinholing.  The bisque temperature is recommended to be at least c06, possibly even higher to c04.  A short soak at the peak temperature may also help.  It is important that all combustibles in the clay body are fired out during the bisque period.  A hold at bisque temperature (approximately c06) during the glaze firing may also help.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>GLAZE APPLICATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When glazing the inside and outside at the same time, absorbed water displaces air in the porous bisque…this trapped air can form air bubbles that can form pinholes in glaze firing<br>
One possible solution for this is to rinse and wipe the bisque, let it sit for an hour before glazing …this leaves some water displacing air in the center of of the wall, thus leaving less air to be displaced and trapped when glazing the wall on both sides at the same time</li>
<li>Rub down pin holes that are visible after you have applied the glaze, or fill in larger holes with watered-down glaze.<br>

<p><strong>From Matthew Katz</strong></p>
<p>Lots of new things to share from my latest workshop at Sierra Nevada College. I’ve been teaching for years that pin-holing is an application issue, and has nothing to do with gas release. This is all The same glaze. On porcelain one pinhole but on the first stoneware test, crazy pinholes. On the second stoneware test the tile was throughly dried after washing, before application. And the student admitted that they washed the test tile for the first sample, right before application. When applied to a dried tile, the pin-holing was radically reduced.</p>
<p>1 glaze, 2 bodies. The tiles on the right in both pics are the same tile, on stoneware. The left pic, left tile is a porcelain. The right pick left tile is the same stoneware as pin-holing sample. But the stoneware was washed and throughly dried, before application. The pin-holed tile was washed but not fully dried before application.</p>

<img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/d01fc4c3b43da9277c87bdda421253d6c375348e.jpg" width="690" height="920"></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>OVERFIRING CLAY</strong><br>
In some instances, over-firing a clay body may lead to pinholes.  Try firing to a slightly lower temperature to see if pinholes can be reduced, or switch clay bodies.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>INCREASING GLAZE MELT</strong><br>
It has been suggested that pinholes are usually less prevalent on vertical surfaces vs. horizontal ones.  This is because the glaze is fluid enough to run down the side of the clay, healing over pinholes.  If you notice this to be the case, you can try to increase the glaze melt by adding more flux.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>GLAZE FIRING SOAK</strong><br>
It is possible that a firing slower to peak temperature or holding at peak temperature during the glaze firing will help to heal over pinholes.  A 15 to 30 minute soak should help.</p>
<p><strong>Drop and soak</strong><br>
After soaking on peak temp about 15-30 min. and then dropping temp. for about 40°C and soak again for about 30 min. can be very helpful in eliminating pinholes.</p>
