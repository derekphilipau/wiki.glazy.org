            <p>The amount and types of clay in a glaze recipe can have a major effect on how the glaze applies to bisque when dipping. Below are two experiments that demonstate this effect. Feel free to add any other relevant experiments to the article.</p>
<p>The first experiment varies the percentages of two clays, <a href="https://glazy.org/materials/15512" rel="nofollow noopener">Kaolin G1</a>, and <a href="https://glazy.org/materials/19748" rel="nofollow noopener">B13 Ball Clay</a> (note that Kaolin G1 isn’t really a kaolin). The left and right glazes contain 16% Kaolin G1 and 16% B13 Ball Clay respectively, were formulated to have the same chemistry, and both had a specific gravity of 1.52 to begin with.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/488f0da31c08f148c48e0d3d5dafb12e3967745f.jpeg" alt="Kaolin%20G1%20vs%20B13%20ball" width="327" height="222"><br>
Tiles were dipped for 10 seconds three times, and then for 15 seconds, with 2 days between dips to ensure that they were completely dry. Tiles that showed excessive cracking weren’t dipped the full number of times. Since the tiles were lowered face-down into the glaze, pinholes from the first dip trapped air that resulted in larger craters in subsequent dips.</p>

<p>After each dip, the thickness of the glaze coat was recorded. These measurements are only approximate.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/3976682afc677fe87199d14d144352149d64401f.jpeg" alt="Glaze%20thickness%20KaolinG1%20B13" width="322" height="147"><br>
The tests show that replacing Kaolin G1 with B13 Ball Clay leads to a decrease in application thickness, and initially a decreasing in cracking (it might not be clear in the image above, but in the bottom row, the 16% B13 Ball Clay test shows a crack on the top edge, while the other two tests are crack-free)</p>
<p>The second test is a line blend from 4% B13 Ball Clay to 20% B13 Ball Clay, from left to right, in 4% increments.</p>

All glazes were formulated to have the same chemistry, and had an initial specific gravity of 1.57 (This probably increased after each dip, but wasn’t measured). Here the sequence of dipping times was 15s, 10s, 10s, with at least two days between dips.</p>

<p>As in the first experiment, increasing B13 Ball Clay leads to decrease in the thickness of the glazes coat, and an initial decrease in the amount of cracking.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The specific gravity of a dry material is its weight divided by the weight of water it displaces. <a href="https://wiki.glazy.org/t/brongniarts-formula/780">Brongniart’s formula</a> depends on the specific gravity of the dry materials in a glaze recipe, although for most glazes, this is about 2.6.</p>
<p>If there was no air trapped between the particles of a powdered material, the weight of water (in grams) displaced by a given batch of that material would be equal to the volume of the batch (in millilitres). However, because powdered materials do contain air, the weight of water they displace is somewhat less than their volume.</p>
<h3>List of specific gravities</h3>
<p>(This needs to be expanded. Ideally the specific gravities should be given together with a source, which can be from a spec sheet or an actual measurement)</p>

<h3>Measuring specific gravity</h3>
<p>Fill half a graduated cylinder with water, and note the volume. Add 100g of the material you’re interested in to the graduated cylinder, and stir until there are no more bubbles (Wear a respirator and use good ventilation when working with powdered glaze materials). Note the volume of the mixture in the graduated cylinder. The specific gravity of the material is 100 divided by the difference in volume, measured in millilitres.</p>
<h3>Calculating the specific gravity of a recipe</h3>
<p>If a recipe contains materials with parts by weight <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>2</sub>, …,<em>w</em><sub>n</sub>, and specific gravities <em>s</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>2</sub>, …,<em>s</em><sub>n</sub>, respectively, then its specific gravity is<br>

            <p>This is a formula for determining the quantity of dry materials in a given quantity of glaze slurry. It is named after the former director of the Sèvres Porcelain Factory, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Brongniart" rel="nofollow noopener">Alexandre Brongniart</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of equivalent ways of expressing Brongniart’s formula. If <em>S</em><sub>wet</sub>, <em>M</em><sub>wet</sub>, and <em>V</em><sub>wet</sub> are the specific gravity, mass, and volume of the slurry, and  <em>S</em><sub>dry</sub>, <em>M</em><sub>dry</sub>, and <em>V</em><sub>dry</sub> are the specific gravity, mass, and volume<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://wiki.glazy.org#footnote-1169-1" id="footnote-ref-1169-1">[1]</a></sup> of the dry glaze materials, then<br>

<em>S</em><sub>wet</sub>, <em>M</em><sub>wet</sub>, and <em>V</em><sub>wet</sub> can be measured, and for most glazes, <em>S</em><sub>dry</sub> is around 2.6 (exceptions are glazes which contain substantial amounts of tin or lead.). See the entry on the <a href="https://wiki.glazy.org/t/specific-gravity-of-glaze-materials/781">specific gravity of dry materials</a> for a list of values.</p>
<p>If one substitutes <em>S</em><sub>dry</sub> = 2.6 into (2), the equation can be rewritten as<br>

<p>This requires the weight of the glaze slurry in the bucket, the weight of a syringeful of glaze slurry, and the weight of a syringeful of water (the ratio of the last two measurements gives the specific gravity of the glaze slurry). In theory, the weight of a syringeful of water in grams should equal volume of the syringe in millilitres, but syringes may be inaccurate. The default for the specific gravity of the dry materials is 2.6, but this can be changed.</p>

          <title>Calculations for adjusting Specific Gravity</title>

            <p>This post is about how to calculate the amount of water to add or remove from a glaze to achieve a desired specific gravity.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a glaze with specific gravity <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, but you want to change this to specific gravity <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>. Let <em>W</em> be the weight of the glaze. Then the weight of the same volume of water is <em>W</em> / <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, since<br>
<em>SG</em> = weight of glaze / weight of same volume of water.<br>
(Note that if you’re measuring the weight in grams, the weight of water is the same as its volume in millilitres)</p>
<p>Suppose we add to the glaze a certain quantity of water, of weight <em>X</em>. The glaze now weighs <em>W</em> + <em>X</em>, and the weight of the same volume of water is now <em>W</em> / <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em>. This means the specific gravity is now<br>
(<em>W</em> + <em>X</em>) / (<em>W</em> / <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>X</em>).<br>
If we set this equal to  <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>, we can solve for <em>X</em>. The result is:<br>
<em>X</em> = <em>W</em>(<em>S</em><sub>1</sub> - <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>) / (<em>S</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> - 1)).         . . . . . . . . . . . .(Eq 1)</p>
<p>If <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is greater than <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, i.e. if you want to increase the specific gravity, this will make <em>X</em> negative. In that case, the absolute value of <em>X</em> is the weight of water you need to remove from the glaze.</p>
<p>This calculation has been implemented in the online calculator <a href="https://pietermostert.github.io/SG_calc/html/specific-gravity-1.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pietermostert.github.io/SG_calc/html/specific-gravity-1.html</a>, where instead of having to work out the initial specific gravity <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, you just enter the weight of glaze drawn into a syringe (or poured into a graduated cylinder), and the weight of the same volume of water.</p>
<p>Notice that in (Eq 1), if we know <em>X</em>, <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>, we can solve for <em>W</em>:<br>
<em>W</em> =  <em>X</em> <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> - 1) / (<em>S</em><sub>1</sub> - <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>). . . . . . . . . . . .(Eq 2)<br>
This is useful in situations where it’s impractical to weigh the entire bucket of glaze. In this case, you can take two measurements of specific gravity; the initial measurement <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, and a measurement  <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> obtained after adding a known quantity of water, and stirring thoroughly. You can then use (Eq 2) to work out the initial weight of the glaze, and then plug that into (Eq 1) to work out how much water you should have added in order to reach a target specific gravity <em>S</em><sub>3</sub>. Subtract the weight of water you’ve already added from this, and you’ll know how much water you still need to add (or remove, if you added too much).</p>
<p>It will be convenient to express the weight of water you still need to add, <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, in terms of the weight of water already added, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>, and the specific gravities <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>S</em><sub>3</sub>. It turns out that the easiest way to derive this equation is by starting with the glaze at the intermediate step, after the first quantity of water has been added. If the weight of the glaze at this stage is <em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, then from (Eq 2),<br>
<em>W</em><sub>1</sub> =  <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>S</em><sub>3</sub> - 1) / (<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> - <em>S</em><sub>3</sub>). . . . . . . . . . . .(Eq 3)<br>
This is because we change the specific gravity from <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> to <em>S</em><sub>3</sub> by adding water of weight <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Starting from the intermediate step again, we know that if we subtract water of weight <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>, we’ll change the specific gravity from <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> back to <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>. This is the same as adding water of weight -<em>X</em><sub>1</sub>, so from (Eq 2) again:<br>
<em>W</em><sub>1</sub> = - <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>S</em><sub>1</sub> - 1) / (<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> - <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>). . . . . . . . . . . .(Eq 4)</p>
<p>All that’s left to do is equate (Eq 3) and (Eq 4), and solve for <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>:<br>
<em>X</em><sub>2</sub>  =  <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>S</em><sub>1</sub> - 1)(<em>S</em><sub>2</sub> - <em>S</em><sub>3</sub>) / [(<em>S</em><sub>1</sub> - <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>)(<em>S</em><sub>3</sub> - 1)]</p>
<p>This calculation has been implemented in the online calculator <a href="https://pietermostert.github.io/SG_calc/html/specific-gravity-2.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pietermostert.github.io/SG_calc/html/specific-gravity-2.html</a>. Be aware that this method is more sensitive to measurement errors; if <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> is very close to <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, the relative error in <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> - <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> may be large, in which case the relative error in <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> will be large.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if it makes any difference, but I see some people adding 2% bentonite to my JP Purple .25 recipe (and A2/A2V based glazes)…more often than not, people do this to recipes that don’t have bentonite…it usually doesnt make much difference, but it is chemically the same as adding 2% more, in this case, EPK…bentonite, physically, improves the dry strength of the raw glaze, and, in some cases, is the only clay component, for example Val’s Turquoise…being the only clay component gives us the ability to flocculate the mix and have clay particles to floc…I don’t add bentonite to most of my glazes unless they either don’t have enough clay component to floc or the dried glaze is powdery…I always use unmeasured pre-wet CMC in my mixing water, don’t weigh it because it will all burn out anyway…my point is added bentonite can chemically influence fired outcome, for instance, the first time I weighed out Val’s Turquoise, I noticed it had no clay component other than bentonite, and I remember thinking “Oh! That’s why it is so copper blue…smart guy that Val Cushing!”…in many copper glazes, the higher the clay component of clay, the greater the color shifts away from blue and towards green…so we should keep in mind, something as routinely adding bentonite to glaze recipes that don’t have it, is slightly altering the chemistry, maybe not adversely, but still effecting chemistry…in this case with a chrome/tin glaze, we have the possibility of a color shift caused by 2% bentonite, not necessarily adversely, but still a possibility.<br>
Please keep in mind, there nothing wrong with adding bentonite, just be aware of the usually subtle changes it can make in the fired results</p>

<p>Monday, January 28th, 2008</p>
<p>A glaze recipe is almost always listed as a “percentage or batch formula”, adding up to 100.  Every once in a while you’ll run across something that is slightly off (I was shown one adding up to 98.63% recently) -but that’s uncommon.</p>
<p>As stated in my post “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/2008/01/31/getting-started-with-crystalline-glazes/">Getting Started with Crystalline Glazes</a>“, when people ask me for a crystalline glaze recipe (^9-10), I offer them this to start with:</p>
<p>Frit 3110:  <strong>50</strong> %<br>
Zinc Oxide:  <strong>25</strong> %<br>
Silica:  <strong>25</strong> %</p>
<p><strong>50</strong> + <strong>25</strong> + <strong>25</strong> = <strong>100</strong> %</p>
<p>The above would technically be referred to as a  <em>percentage formula</em> . If you wanted to make a small test, you’d probably just want to mix up 100 grams.<br>
This would then be called a 100 gram  <em>batch formula</em> :</p>
<p>Frit 3110:  <strong>50</strong>  grams +<br>
Zinc Oxide:  <strong>25</strong>  grams +<br>
Silica:  <strong>25</strong>  grams<br>
=  <strong>100</strong>  grams</p>
<p>Ok, so say you find that the glaze works, and you want to mix up 600 grams to test further…</p>
<p>Look at the above formula again, like this:</p>
<p>Frit 3110: 50 (x 1) =  <strong>50</strong><br>
Zinc Oxide: 25 (x 1) =  <strong>25</strong><br>
Silica: 25 (x 1) =  <strong>25</strong><br>
= <strong>100</strong> , right?</p>
<p>So for  <strong>600</strong>  grams:</p>
<p>Frit 3110: 50 (x 6) =  <strong>300</strong>  +<br>
Zinc Oxide: 25 (x 6) =  <strong>150</strong>  +<br>
Silica: 25 (x 6) =  <strong>150</strong><br>
=  <strong>600</strong>  grams</p>
<p>For  <strong>800</strong>  grams, multiply each part by  <strong>8</strong> ,<br>
for  <strong>950</strong>  grams, multiply each part by  <strong>9.5</strong> ,<br>
and for  <strong>1000</strong>  grams, multiply by  <strong>10</strong> .</p>
<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://www.johnbrittpottery.com/">John Britt</a>’s book “Complete Guide to High Fire Glazes”, I list an  <em>Alkaline Base</em>  Recipe:</p>
<p>Frit 3110:  <strong>51</strong><br>
Calcined Zinc Oxide:  <strong>23</strong><br>
Silica:  <strong>22</strong><br>
Grolleg Kaolin:  <strong>2.5</strong><br>
Alumina Hydrate:  <strong>1.5</strong><br>
=  <strong>100</strong> %</p>
<p>The above formula is called a  <em>base glaze</em> . Base glazes typically come out clear or white. To this you can add colorants, modifiers, binders, etc. These are  <em>not</em>  usually listed as part of the formula, but you’d still multiply each one by the same number, to get an equal proportion in the glaze.<br>
For  <strong>750</strong>  grams…<br>
Frit 3110: 51 (x 7.5) =  <strong>382.5</strong>  grams<br>
Calcined Zinc Oxide: 23 (x 7.5) =  <strong>172.5</strong>  grams<br>
Silica: 22 (x 7.5) =  <strong>165</strong>  grams<br>
Grolleg Kaolin: 2.5 (x 7.5) =  <strong>18.75</strong>  grams<br>
Alumina Hydrate: 1.5 (x 7.5) =  <strong>11.25</strong>  grams</p>
<p>To get the dark blue glaze pictured on pg. 137 of Britt’s book, add:<br>
Cobalt Oxide: 3 (x 7.5) =  <strong>22.5</strong>  grams<br>
Manganese Dioxide: 3 (x 7.5) =  <strong>22.5</strong>  grams<br>
Red Iron Oxide: 3 (x 7.5) =  <strong>22.5</strong>  grams<br>
Bentonite (or CMC as a binder): 1 (x 7.5) =  <strong>7.5</strong>  grams</p>
<p>So you have  <strong>750</strong>  grams of the base +  <strong>75</strong>  grams of colorant and binder =  <strong>825</strong>  grams.<br>
Now you can use that result to calculate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/2008/01/28/adding-water-suspendersbinders-to-a-glaze/">how much water to add</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hydrating the Glaze:</strong></p>
<p>To hydrate a glaze for application whether it be by brushing, spraying, dipping, etc., you need to achieve the same result each time you go to glaze. Every glaze is going to act different and require varying levels of water content to get the consistency that works for you.</p>
<p>When I discussed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/2008/01/28/reading-calculating-measuring-a-glaze-recipe/">reading of a glaze recipe</a> in another post, I left off with this example:</p>
<p>Frit 3110: 51 (x 7.5) =  <strong>382.5</strong>  grams<br>
Calcined Zinc Oxide: 23 (x 7.5) =  <strong>172.5</strong>  grams<br>
Silica: 22 (x 7.5) =  <strong>165</strong>  grams<br>
Grolleg Kaolin: 2.5 (x 7.5) =  <strong>18.75</strong>  grams<br>
Alumina Hydrate: 1.5 (x 7.5) =  <strong>11.25</strong>  grams</p>
<p>To get the dark blue glaze pictured on pg. 137 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/links/">John Britt</a>’s book, add:<br>
Cobalt Oxide: 3 (x 7.5) =  <strong>22.5</strong>  grams<br>
Manganese Dioxide: 3 (x 7.5) =  <strong>22.5</strong>  grams<br>
Red Iron Oxide: 3 (x 7.5) =  <strong>22.5</strong>  grams<br>
Bentonite (or CMC as a binder): 1 (x 7.5) =  <strong>7.5</strong>  grams</p>
<p>This glaze has  <strong>750</strong>  grams of the base +  <strong>75</strong>  grams of colorant and binder =  <strong>825</strong>  grams.</p>
<p>When calculating how much water to add, weigh each component, and multiply by the percentage of water content you need. Again, every glaze is different –clay content, modifiers, and even certain colorants factor into this. So you’ll have to add water, adjust as needed, and record that % for later reference.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you want to start with 50% water, take the 825 gram example and multiply by 50%:<br>
825 x 0.50 = 412.5</p>
<p>412.5 can translate to cubic centimeters (cc), milliliters, or grams, depending on how you wish to measure it out. I use a graduated cylinder (ml) or large syringe (cc).<br>
50% water will probably not be enough, but it’s better to err on that side, as you can always add more water.</p>
<p>A crystalline glaze contains little to no clay and usually a large amount of fritted or calcined components. If you add only water to it, it will soon settle like fine sand, and be extremely difficult to work with. When applied to your work, it will crack, peel, and flake off during drying. This is why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/2007/09/29/glaze-suspension-binder-products-i-use/">suspenders and binders</a> are added.</p>
<p><strong>Gum Water Solutions</strong> :</p>
<p>In the case of the above recipe, 1% Bentonite or CMC is listed (1% is offered as a rough figure only). Either must be thoroughly mixed with the other dry ingredients before water is added, or it will form irregular clumps. I prefer to mix them into water before hand. You can buy pre-mixed “gels” from commercial suppliers, but it’s hard to know how much of what you will be adding, so I like to make my own. Take note that if your glaze recipe has a large enough clay content, then additives like these are likely unnecessary, and can result in a gummy mess.<br>
I had heard about pre-mixing CMC, etc into water through potters such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://www.fixpots.com/">Jeff Zamek</a>. But it didn’t sink in just how simple and effective it could be until John Tilton and I visited our friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://www.fpottery.com/">Kris Friedrich</a> at his studio. I have since kept premixed &amp; hydrated forms of many ingredients in air tight containers, ready for use.</p>
<p>Using CMC as an example then, I often add 0.5-2.0 grams of dry CMC powder per every 8oz of water. The amount of CMC necessary will depend upon what type of CMC you have. Some CMC will actually contain larger particle wood pulp as a filler, whereas certain “food grade” varieties are so powerful that the 0.5gCMC : 8ozH2O ratio is enough.</p>
<p>Blend the powder into warm water until mixed, let it sit for an hour or so (or preferably overnight), and blend again before use. This pre-hydrated gum solution can then be mixed with the dry glaze batch to produce a usable consistency (52-72% of the dry glaze weight works well in my crystalline bases).</p>
<p>Include the weight of all additions (colorants, etc.) and round the decimal.<br>
Example:<br>
825 grams of dry ingredients X 0.55 = 453.75 (round to 454) cc/ml of gum solution.</p>
<p>I mix the dry glaze ingredients and gum solution in a blender until it’s uniform, and then pass the glaze through a 80-100 mesh sieve. One trick is to add the water to the glaze and let it sit for a 1/2 hour or so. It will mix faster and go much easier on your blender.</p>
<p>Some CMC’s are infused with a fungicide.  This prevents it from decomposing and losing it’s strength.  Many crystalline artists agree that keeping their glazes for long periods of time has bad consequences; however, if you choose to do so, simply add 0.02% Copper Carbonate to the gum solution when mixing it up.  This will deter organic growth and at that level, it won’t discolor even white/clear glazes.</p>
<p>Lastly, I suggest weighing the hydrated glaze to obtain a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/2008/01/26/specific-gravity/">specific gravity</a>. By doing this, you can adjust the glaze if, e.g., it loses water during storage. If the specific gravity is off, your viscosity will more than likely change as well, and you can easily add too much or too little glaze during later applications, skewing the results.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of a liquid is simply the weight of the dry components in relation to the water. If the specific gravity of your glaze or slip changes too much, you could be applying too much or too little, which may prevent you from getting repeatable results. Finding the correct specific gravity for your methods is part of a trial and error process. As a starting point, the target for most glazes and slips is between 1.50 -1.80. Once you have found what works best, taking and recording a measurement will allow you to adjust the glaze as it loses water during use, storage, etc.<br>
I usually try to keep my glazes within a “certain window”, and use the specific gravity as a guide for returning to, when things get far enough off. Having said that, some of my glazes are  <em>extremely</em>  application sensitive (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/2007/10/19/57/">Reddn’d Rainbow</a> is a good example), so I’ll take particular care to be accurate with those.</p>
<p>Since the weight of 100ml of distilled water equals 100 grams, the best way to get a reading is by taking a 100ml sample of your glaze or slip and weigh it using an accurate scale and a graduated cylinder.<br>
Tare the scale to the weight of the graduated cylinder, and carefully fill it to the 100ml mark.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
(100ml water = 100grams)<br>
100ml slip/glaze = 160grams.<br>
The specific gravity is said to be 1.6, as it is 1.6 times the weight of water.</p>
<p>If the Specific Gravity is too high, you can lower it by adding water.<br>
Take care to  <strong>add only water</strong>  (not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224151058/http://jessehull.com/2008/01/28/adding-water-suspendersbinders-to-a-glaze/">gum solution</a>). The binder or suspension agent does not evaporate with the water, so the water content alone is all that needs adjusting. Also, understand that it takes much less water than you think to thin a glaze, so adjust a little at a time.<br>
If the specific gravity is too low, add more dry materials in the correct proportions regarding the clay or glaze formula.</p>
<p>Temperature also plays a role. In the winter, I have my studio thermostat programmed for a lower temperature during the late night/ early morning hours when I’m not working. I have therefore noticed a difference when measuring the specific gravity first thing in the morning, as compared to later after the heater’s been running for several hours. I get past this by blending the glaze for a few minutes each time I take a reading. Be careful not to blend too long, as the high shear friction can cause the liquid to heat up and skew the reading.<br>
To be really precise then, the readings should actually be done with a thermometer as well.</p>
<p>In a future post, I will discuss how  <em>Viscosity/Rheology</em>  factors into all of this.</p>

            <p>This is the ball mill that I purchased in Jingdezhen about 5 years ago.  I believe the cost was around 2400RMB, approximately $350USD.</p>
<p>The mill accommodates two large jars on the top level and two small jars on the bottom level.</p>

<h2>The Motor</h2>
<p>Company: 上海尼丰机电<br>
Model number YY7144, 220V, 550W, 6.5A, 50Hz, speed 1400r/min.</p>
<p>The large jars rotate at around 80 revolutions per minute.</p>
<p><em>From Ray Aldridge via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The right speed is a function of the jars internal diameter. According to Cardew, the right speed is 64 to 87% of critical speed, which can be found by using this formula:<br>
Critical speed in rpm=54.19 divided by the square root of R (when R is the internal radius expressed in feet)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Large jar internal diameter 24cm = .79ft<br>
.79ft / 2 = .395ft radius<br>
square root of .395 = .628<br>
54.19 / .628 = <strong>86.3RPM critical speed</strong></p>
<p><em>Mill should be operated at 55-75RPM.  Currently at 80RPM.</em></p>

<h2>Jars</h2>
<p>The jars are locally made in Jingdezhen using a strong porcelain body.  Each jar is individually thrown (note the throwing rings) and has a heavy rubber stopper that is gently hammered in.  The jars are only glazed on the outside.</p>
<p>Notice the rubber stoppers do not have locks. Even though quite a lot of pressure builds up inside the jar during milling, the rubber stoppers have never fallen out during use.</p>
<p>Two large jars on top level:<br>

<h2>Grinding Media</h2>
<p>Two types of grinding media are commonly sold in Jingdezhen, porcelain balls and a special type of natural stone (needs research).  The natural stones come in a variety of sizes.  According to the ball mill manufacturer’s recommendation, I only fill each jar with about 1/3 media.  When wet grinding glaze, I only fill the jar half-way.  The mill should be very loud when in use.</p>

<p>Yes its true that for he most part, the materials we purchase to make glaze are finely ground. Once they become part of a glaze mixture, a suspension of materials in an aqueous solution, one would expect that these materials and their respective particles are uniformly distributed. For the most part, yes. But it might be worthwhile to think about how these materials melt in the kiln, how they sit on the surface of the ware as they melt, and what influences an optimum glaze surface. Theres no need for lengthy chemistry and physics here. Suffice it to say that it is the grind of these materials, the nature of glass structure relative to the grind that plays a very important part to optimum surface development. For instance, lets say you go to Feldspar mine in Spruce Pine NC and get some crude feldspar before it is selectively processed. And lets further say you hand grind it in your morter and pestle or other some such device. Add some water, make a crude solution and apply it and fire it. Chances are that the surface will be rough, perhaps the glass will be undeveloped. Run the same test with some processed spar, and the results will be dramatically different(same temperature). Voila, illustrating that the grind of the material is directly responsible for the optimum surface development, the melt. Sure if you fire any material to a hot enough temperature it will flow, but thats not the point here. It is the action of milling that effects the particle size and hence the melt, the fluidity of the melt, etc etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So ball milling renders a solution more homogeneous by the milling action of the grinding media, the amount of charge in the mill, the speed of rotation in the mill, and the time the solution is in the mill being processed. There is an optimum balance between all these factors relative to the glaze. Too much milling will result in a glaze solution that has absolutely no surface tension whatsoever and will run off the pot.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do we need to ball mill all our glazes? Probably not, and as most on the list who make glazes have seen that a simple jiffy mixer followed by some selective seiving will produce a glaze that for the most part, will work well. But, we also know that all glazes are not the same and perhaps some may require ball milling to produce the proper effect. Ball milling is also one of the things that may be out of reach for studio potters in that a one gallon ball mill jar is faily heavy and large, the mill needed to turn it is substantial, and if you have a 30 gallon batch, you gonna mill 30 times? Plus that one gallon jar doesnt hold one gallon. And on it goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So we also need to get some terminology right.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What we often refer to as ball mills is kind of generic. Refers to a rotating jar with a charge of grinding material and stuff to grind up. According to US Stoneware (one of the largest producers of mills) ball mills of their manufacture range from 12-210 gallon capacity and ar quite substantial pieces of equipment, both in the size (physical footprint) and price for most potters. These are some hefty pieces of equipment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is more akin to what we use are called jar mills and can be as simple as one jar, multiple jars on one tier, or on multiple tiers, short rollers or long rollers, etc.etc. These can be belt driven, chain driven, one speed or multiple/variable speeds.  More affordable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why so expensive? The simple answer is just because. These are industrial manufactured devices and I am sure carry the manufacturers hefty overhead, especially for items like liability insurance and a myriad of others. In concept, yes, these are simple devices and are well within the scope of shop built equipment if you need one. I would posit that most studio potters dont need a jar mill for their glazes unless the specific glaze is extremely problematic and can be beneficiated by selective milling. Val suggests that terra sigs should be milled, This is a specific application in which a mill could be and probably is very useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Grinding Media</h2>
<p>Dan Taylor via Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You need grinding media in a ball-mill that has some tooth, like pebbles of porcelain.  Glass or steel is too smooth.  I use high fire, very dense porcelain balls of various sizes. Industry says you should fill your mill jar half full of balls, half of which (by weight) are the largest, and two other sizes 50/50.  Im not sure what ratio I use and I dont think you have to be that specific but it is most efficient if all the balls are not the same size. You can make your own.  They will wear down in time but the amount that is left in your glaze is so miniscule as not to matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steve Grimmer via Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can extrude balls for your mill from a nice, tight porcelain body. Use a round die about 3/8  in diameter. Cut the long coils into cylinders about 3/8 long, fire to maturity in a pile on a shelf or in a bowl, and then run them in your mill by themselves for 12 hours or so to knock off any rough points. Now you are in business.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Speed as related to internal jar diameter</h2>
<p>From Ray Aldridge via Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The right speed is a function of the jars internal diameter. According to Cardew, the right speed is 64 to 87% of critical speed, which can be found by using this formula:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical speed in rpm=54.19 divided by the square root of R (when R is the internal radius expressed in feet)</p>

<h2>Measuring Specific Gravity</h2>
<p>There are two ways that potters determine the specific gravity (s.g.) (relative density) of their glazes and slips, by <strong>weight</strong> and <strong>hydrometer readings</strong>.</p>
<h2>Measuring Specific Gravity by Weight (Recommended)</h2>
<p>Vince Pitelka on Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My preference is to measure density by weight as compared to water, because that’s what specific gravity is – a measure of the density of a liquid in comparison to water.  For this you need a sturdy cup of twelve to sixteen ounces capacity with an absolutely level rim and no dips, high spots, or pour spouts in the rim, and with a diameter less than its height.  An aluminum or stainless steel tumbler works well and will last forever, but any sturdy metal or plastic container that meets these requirements will work, or even a glass or ceramic container as long as it has a sharp inside edge at the rim.  The size doesn’t really matter as long as it is at least twelve ounces. A smaller cup and/or a large diameter rim proportionally increase the likelihood of error.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Place the cup on the gram scale and zero the weight with the tare beam, or if your scale does not have a tare function, weigh the cup and record the weight on the outside of the cup with a permanent marker and also in your notebook.  Leave the cup on the scale platform and carefully fill it with water from a pitcher or measuring cup until the top of the meniscus is right at the rim.  The meniscus is the curve in the surface of a fluid right where it meets the wall of its container, and it is important to make sure that the meniscus comes right up to the exact rim.  That’s why having a dedicated weighing container with a fairly sharp edge at the rim is critical.  Weigh the container full of water and record the weight on the outside of the container with permanent marker (and in your notebook), or if you do not have the tare function subtract the weight of the container and then record the weight of the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To determine the specific gravity of a glaze, place the clean, dry container on the gram scale and zero the tare beam and then carefully fill the container with glaze using a measuring cup or pitcher, and make sure the meniscus comes right to the rim of the container just as you did with the water.  It is essential that you are absolutely consistent in this with every glaze.  Weigh the container and record the weight in your notebook (subtracting the weight of the container if you do not have the tare function).  To get the specific gravity, divide the weight of the glaze by the weight of the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s instructive to know the specific gravity of each of your glazes, but the measurement used to reproduce the same glaze fired in subsequent batches is the ideal weight of the liquid glaze in the weighing cup.  It often takes many repeated test firings to get the visual results you seek, or you may get lucky with the first firing.  When you are happy with the fired results, use the weighing cup and accurately weigh the glaze and record the weight and specific gravity digitally or the old fashioned way in your recipe file.  This process must be repeated with every glaze, because there’s no assurance that the ideal specific gravity of one glaze will work for another.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When mixing a new batch, thin the mixed, blended glaze with water until it is a little thicker than desired, and then start checking with the weighing cup, pouring the glaze back into the bucket, thinning with a little water and blending, checking with the weighing cup again, repeating this until you get it right on.  Make sure that the cup is dry and free of glaze on the outside each time you place it on the weighing platform and refill it.  Once you’re experienced at this, it goes very fast.  Keep in mind that any freshly mixed glaze will thicken up a bit overnight as the particles continue to absorb water, and the weight should be checked and adjusted the next day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Greg Lamont on Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could always find the specific gravity the old fashioned way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Zero out your gram scale and use the poise tare bar to balance out a clear container.</li>
<li>Fill this containter with 100 grams of water</li>
<li>Carefully mark the level of the water on the container with an indelible fine-point marker. ( Accuracy is  important here).</li>
<li>Empty out the water and fill container to the mark with terra sig, glaze or slip.  (Accuracy is important here,  too).</li>
<li>Balance out scale to the new weight.  If the scale reads 120 grams the ratio is 1.2, etc.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This method is  the one Pete Pinnell taught me to use as it is always very accurate and foolproof!  Some hydrometers are meant to measure solutions and not suspensions–which is what glazes, slips, etc. are.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Measuring Specific Gravity with a Beaker</h2>
<p>Adjust the specific gravity of the glaze. Here, a 250ml beaker is zeroed-out.<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/387e449f47c11146e5b766531dfab8a0124d4df5.jpg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/387e449f47c11146e5b766531dfab8a0124d4df5" title="IMG_4712edit-1200x1200.jpg"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/387e449f47c11146e5b766531dfab8a0124d4df5.jpg" width="690" height="690" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/387e449f47c11146e5b766531dfab8a0124d4df5_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>The weight of 250ml glaze is 386.7. Dividing by the weight of water, 386.7/250 = 1.55. For this glaze, 1.5-1.6 is a good pouring thickness.  (Using a 100ml sample it’s even easier to calculate the specific gravity, in this example the weight would be 155g with specific gravity of 1.55.)<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ef2a96c1a8ea95fcadee75af7dc12cb1b44a3590.jpg" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/ef2a96c1a8ea95fcadee75af7dc12cb1b44a3590" title="IMG_4713edit-1200x1200.jpg"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ef2a96c1a8ea95fcadee75af7dc12cb1b44a3590.jpg" width="690" height="690" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ef2a96c1a8ea95fcadee75af7dc12cb1b44a3590_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<h2>Measuring Specific Gravity with a Syringe</h2>
<p>Zero-out the empty syringe on the scale.  Ideally, use a 100ml syringe.<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/6bfbfcb4c91300e69720690f05f6196600395035.JPG" data-download-href="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/6bfbfcb4c91300e69720690f05f6196600395035" title="IMG_5407.JPG"><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/6bfbfcb4c91300e69720690f05f6196600395035_2_690x517.JPG" width="690" height="517" srcset="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/6bfbfcb4c91300e69720690f05f6196600395035_2_690x517.JPG, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/6bfbfcb4c91300e69720690f05f6196600395035_2_1035x775.JPG 1.5x, https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/6bfbfcb4c91300e69720690f05f6196600395035_2_1380x1034.JPG 2x" data-small-upload="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/6bfbfcb4c91300e69720690f05f6196600395035_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Divide the weight of the glaze by the volume of the syringe:  76.93 / 50 = 1.54<br>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrometer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hydrometer</a></h3>

<p>A hydrometer is an instrument used for measuring the relative density of liquids based on the concept of buoyancy. They are typically calibrated and graduated with one or more scales such as specific gravity.
 A hydrometer usually consists of a sealed hollow glass tube with a wider bottom portion for buoyancy, a ballast such as lead or mercury for stability, and a narrow stem with graduations for measuring. The liquid to test is poured into a tall container, often a graduated cylinder, and the hy...</p>

<p>Dick White on Clayart on buying the correct hydrometer, and the difference between SG and Baume:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In common usage, specific gravity as measured with the proper hydrometer (there are two types, one for liquids lighter than water, such as alcohol (beer and wine) and one for liquids heavier than water, such as glaze; the alcohol ones are quite common in the marketplace for beer and wine home brewers, the one for heavier liquids is not as common, and unsuspecting potters might buy the wrong one) is different from specific gravity as measured by weight on a scale…  But more to the point<br>
now, the numbers don’t correlate. The only one that is the same in both scales is 45 degrees Baume on a heavy hydrometer is 1.45 SG. As the degrees Baume go up from there, the specific gravity increases faster, e.g., 50 degrees Baume is 1.53 SG. And going the other way, the relationship reverses below 45, e.g., 40 degrees Baume is 1.38 SG. So, depending on whether the glaze maker is using a hydrometer and you are using a scale, or vice versa, you may be mixing to the same number but getting different results.</p>

<p>Vince Pitelka on Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am disturbed by the conclusion that floating hydrometers are not accurate, and the possible misinterpretation of that conclusion by many who could greatly benefit from using a glaze hydrometer. It is certainly true that a particular specific gravity of one glaze, measured with a standard glaze hydrometer, cannot be expected to work with another glaze, for the reasons mentioned. But for 16 years or so I have used a hydrometer to standardize glaze mixing - once I have a specific gravity reading from a glaze that performs well, I can use that reading to attain the same performance from subsequent batches of the same glaze. It has been a tremendous help. Also, I now use a great deal of terra sigillatas with my students, and I cannot imagine making them without my hydrometer. I have achieved super-refined terra sigs which give a high-luster in one coating and a single polishing, and the only way I am able to do this with consistency is by very carefully measuring specific gravity with a floating hydrometer in the initial mix before settling, and in the final mix to be applied to the wares.<br>
I guess what all this means is that the hydrometer reading is relative rather than absolute, but when used to obtain similar results in a given batch-recipe, once the ideal specific gravity for that recipe is known, it can be extremely helpful.</p>

<h2>Problems using Hydrometers</h2>
<p>Bill Aycock on Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High viscosity and gelled slurries will effect the measurements taken with a hydrometer if care is not taken to make sure the instrument is free to move up and down. This may involve stirring the mix (if it is Thixotropic) or waiting a while for the gadget to move.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Hesselberth on Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are using it for clay or glaze slips/slurries, hydrometers are notoriously imprecise for suspensions. They work OK for single phase materials. Rather get yourself a 100 ml graduated cylinder and weigh 100 ml of your glaze/slip. It will be much more precise, just as accurate and just about as simple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill Campbell on Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hygrometers are good in fluids that arent viscous, however they arent too good in slip, and glaze. They tend to give a different result each time that they are used in the same batch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dick White on CAD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, about hydrometers generally - they measure the density of a liquid based on buoyancy, i.e., by how deep in the liquid it floats. In a less dense liquid it will sink deeper, and in in a more dense liquid it will float higher. The scale marked on the side of the glass tube is there for reference (and repeatability). Unfortunately, there are several different scales for different purposes. One of the scales is intended for liquids that are less dense than water, such as alcohol. Hydrometers with this scale are typically used by beer and wine makers. Another scale is intended for liquids more dense than water, such as water containing dissolved or suspended things. These scales are do not give you the same number result for the same liquid. Thus if someone with a light beer hydrometer measures a glaze slurry and tells you the number, and you have a heavy hydrometer and use that number to adjust your glaze, it’s going to be wrong. From your description, your hydrometer has multiple scales marked on it, but you still need to know which scale was the one used by the other person before your glaze will be the same.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the scale does not equate to specific gravity. A hydrometer measures in degrees Baume. (Google it for a more complete explanation.) Yes, you can do some math to convert degrees Baume to physical specific gravity, but now you’ve added a layer of complication. Particularly if someone who has no idea of the differences tells you the “specific gravity” of a glaze is xyz, as measured with their handy dandy hydrometer. Not quite as absurd as reporting humidity as measured with a barometer, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Finally, a hydrometer, even if you understand all the nuances of the scaling, is notoriously inaccurate for measuring the density/specific gravity of glaze slurries because of the thixotropic characteristics of glaze slurries. The “friction” the glaze slurry exerts on the sides of the hydrometer will cause the hydrometer to come to rest somewhere other than where it’s proper buoyancy should leave it. Particularly thixotropic glaze slurries, such as those high in Gerstley Borate or Neph Sye, change their apparent hydrometer levels depending on how recently the slurry has been vigorously stirred. For some glazes, that can be near instantaneous; by the time the stirred slurry stops swirling in the bucket enough that you can drop the hydrometer in without it being smashed on the side of the bucket or being pulled under, it is already thickening up and the hydrometer will sit too high.</p>
<p>So, where does one go now? As suggested, true specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of the glaze to the weight of an equal amount of pure water. Some have suggested a 100ml beaker. Another possibility is a veterinary syringe of 10 or 100ml. You might find something appropriate in the drugstore. The point is find something that holds an exact 10 or 100ml of liquid. 10ml of water weighs exactly 10 grams, and 100ml = 100g. This simply makes the math easy. A container measuring some other amount requires calculator math to derive the ratio. Now, put your  empty10/100ml container on the digital scale and tare/zero it to take the weight of the container out of play. Fill the container with exactly 10 or 100 ml of glaze and weigh it again. The weight of the glaze will convert to specific gravity just by shifting the decimal point. 15.2 grams of 10 ml of glaze is a S.G. of 152. If you are using a 100ml container, the weight of the glaze in grams is the S.G. without shifting the decimal.</p>

<h2>When to Measure Specific Gravity</h2>
<p><em>Vince Pitelka via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you initially mix ceramic materials with water, you are only wetting the outside of the particles.  Those particles are absorbent to some degree, and over a week or so they always absorb more water and the mix thickens up. That’s why a claybody mixed to the perfect consistency will be too stiff a few weeks later.  So it is normal to have to add water and check the SG again.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Determining Best Specific Gravity for each Glaze</h2>
<p>Ben Shelton on Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now comes the big question. What specific gravity will be BEST for each glaze? For me, this is always a trial and error exercise. Because all potters methods vary, and all pots vary, this can be a hard number to nail down. Mix up a 300g test batch, to measure the glazes specific gravity, make a test tile, add water, repeat. Mark the tiles so youll know which specific gravity worked best! Fire the tests and see what looks best. Then use that data to adjust your studio glazes specific gravity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michael McDowell on Clayart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no one correct Specific gravity for a glaze. It is strictly a matter of trial and error &amp; error &amp; trial to determine for each glaze &amp; method of application what the target reading should be. Keep notes. Once I have found my desired S. G. for a new glaze, I put a tag on the bucket with the target reading so its right there in view whenever I am mixing &amp; applying the glaze.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Relationship of Specific Gravity to the Baume Scale</h2>
<p>Pieter Mostert:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I understand it, the (heavy) Baume scale defines x degrees Baume to be the density of a mixture of water and table salt (NaCl), where the salt makes up x% of the mass of the mixture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To relate this to the specific gravity, consider adding y kg of salt to 1 kg of water. The salt then makes up y/(1+y) times 100% of the mass of the mixture, so x = 100y/(1+y) is the density in degrees Baume.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, we can work out the specific gravity by taking the weight in kg (i.e. 1+y) divided by the volume in litres, which is of the form 1+Ay, where A is some constant*. Therefore s.g. = (1+y)/(1+Ay).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you use the equation x = 100y/(1+y) to solve for y in terms of x, and substitute this into the equation<br>
s.g. = (1+y)/(1+Ay), you’ll find s.g. = 100/(100 + (A-1)x). Experimentally, the constant A is about 0.31, so<br>
s.g = 100/(100 - 0.69 x) = 145/(145 - x).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>*Initially I thought this constant would be the inverse of the density of salt, but because of some counterintuitive stuff that happens when salt dissolves in water, this isn’t the case. Some caveats: A depends on the temperature, and might change when the solution becomes oversaturated. I think these changes are relatively small though. (Apologies to any chemists reading this for misrepresenting your field)</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%C3%A9_scale" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Baumé scale</a></h3>

<p>The Baumé scale is a pair of hydrometer scales developed by French pharmacist Antoine Baumé in 1768 to measure density of various liquids. The unit of the Baumé scale has been notated variously as degrees Baumé, B°, Bé° and simply Baumé (the accent is not always present). One scale measures the density of liquids heavier than water and the other, liquids lighter than water. The Baumé of distilled water is 0. The API gravity scale is based on errors in early implementations of the Baumé scale.
