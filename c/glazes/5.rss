          <title>Effect of Iron Oxide and Phase Separation on the Color of Blue Jun Ware Glaze</title>

            <p><em>Fen Wang∗, Changan Yang, Jianfeng Zhu, and Ying Lin Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710021, China</em></p>
<p>Based on the traditional Jun ware glaze, the imitated Jun ware glazes were prepared by adding iron oxide and introducing phase separation agent apatite through four-angle-method. The effect of iron oxide contents, phase separation and the firing temperature on the color of Jun ware glazes were investigated by a neutral atmosphere experiment, optical microscope and scanning electronic microscope. The results showed that the colorant, mainly Fe2O3, contributed to the Jun ware glaze blue and cyan colors of Jun ware glaze. The light scatter caused by the small droplets in phase separation structure only influenced the shade of the glaze color, intensify or weaken the color, and thus made the glaze perfect and elegant opal visual effects, but was not the origin of general blue or cyan colors of Jun ware glaze. In addition, the firing temperature and the basic glaze composition affected the glaze colors to some extent.</p>

<p>Science for Potters, by Linda Bloomfield, covers those aspects of science that are useful to potters and that help to give a deeper understanding of ceramic materials and processes. By gaining a deeper understanding of materials, their structure, composition, origins, and how they interact, potters can have greater control over and new insights into their craft.</p>
<p>Many people think that science is a subject that is at the opposite end of the spectrum from art. But ceramic artists know that ceramics IS science as much as it is art. Trouble is, science is a subject that doesn’t come easily for some. That’s why Linda Bloomfield, who was trained as a scientist before becoming a potter, wrote  <em>Science for Potters</em> .</p>
<h3>You’ll learn about:</h3>
<ul>
<li>the basics of chemistry in clear and simple terms</li>
<li>how the chemistry and structure of clay bodies affects their working properties</li>
<li>what makes a stable glaze</li>
<li>how materials interact in a glaze</li>
<li>glaze faults and how to correct them</li>
<li>substitutions for glaze materials that are no longer available</li>
<li>the glaze unity molecular formula and why it’s so important</li>
</ul>
<h3>The basics and beyond!</h3>
<p>Beginning with the basics, Linda covers the structure of the atom, how atoms combine to make compounds, and why some compounds can be used to make colored pigments and glazes. You’ll discover how things like the Moh’s Scale of Hardness can help you formulate scratch-resistant glazes or how the Periodic Table of the Elements pertains specifically to ceramics.</p>
<h3>Geology and the potter!</h3>
<p>Linda focuses on the aspects of geology, chemistry, and materials science that are relevant to potters. The properties of clays are explained by examining their chemistry and structure, and the various rocks and minerals used in glaze making are explored. By understanding how the structure of different clays affects their working properties, potters can select clays appropriate to the forming and firing methods they choose to use.</p>
<h3>Glazing and Firing</h3>
<p>Making sure your glaze fits your clay body is something that cannot be ignored by the potter, and a chapter is dedicated to glaze fit. Within that chapter, Bloomfield explains glaze faults and how to correct the. She also includes an exceptionally clear explanation of the changes that clay goes through during firing to become ceramic. The deeper understanding of materials, their structure, composition, origins, and how they interact will give potters greater control over and new insights into their craft.</p>
<h3>Appendixes</h3>
<p>Useful appendixes include a glossary, ceramic materials list, Orton Cone Chart, Phase Diagram for Silica-Almina-Calcia, materials analysis charts for both US and UK frits, clays and feldspars, a complete Periodic Table of the Elements and an index.</p>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Linda Bloomfield was born in Ithaca, New York. She grew up in England and studied engineering at Warwick University, with a year at MIT during her PhD studies. She spent a year in Tsukuba, Japan, working for NEC (Nippon Electric Company), then returned to London to work as a researcher at Imperial College. She started her pottery career while living in California, where she became familiar with US potters’ materials. She now lives in London where she makes porcelain tableware, teaches glaze courses, and writes pottery books.</p>

          <title>Traditional Celadons</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[chenyu_lu]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Chinese celadon</p>
<p>Primitive celadons had been discovered all over China but concentrated in Zhejiang province. The earliest examples can be dated to the 3rd century B.C. in the late Zhou period. Similar vessels have also been found in Han tombs. They often resemble ritual bronze vessels, and the glazes tend to be uneven, imperfectly fired and brownish yellow in color.</p>
<p>The Yue wares were first produced in the Eastern Han period (1st – 3rd c.) in Hangzhou. In these earliest wares the body is a light grey between stoneware and porcelain, and the glaze varies from light olive to green. Yue ware developed further until it reached its peak from the Tang dynasty to Song dynasty. Mise (secret/forbidden color) ware is a variety of Yue ware first made for royal use in the Wuyue Kingdom (10th c.) of the Five Dynasties period, which is highly vitreous and renowned for their clear colors. Generally, glazes in this period transitioned from grey and olive to mostly green, and carved decoratioons depict a range of motifs from animal, floral to Buddhist. In the Tang dynasty Yue wares were a staple export, and fragments have been found in places as far as the Persian Gulf. Yue wares were found in temples and tombs in Japan and Korea, and arrival of Yue potters is likely to have helped the development of Koryu celadon in the 11th century.</p>
<p>Ru wares were produced in northern China, specifically commissioned for the imperial court in the Song dynasty (10-13th c.), and were considered the first among the “Five Great Kilns” in that period. Ru wares have simple, sometimes angular shapes. Some were left plain, and others decorated with elaborated carving of floral or animal motifs. The wares tend to be fully glazed and fired with tiny “sesame” stilts. The glaze is applied in several layers and differ in color, from green to sky blue to extremely pale blue. In order to imitate the appearance of jade, a thick texture “like lard dissolving” is desired. Ru wares were and stay very rare, since they were only in production for several decades at the end of the 11th century or start of the 12th century. The scarcity prompted attempts to reproduce these extremely valuable wares. They were imitated in Korean shortly after initial production, and Yongzheng Emperor (1723-35) of the Qing dynasty ordered potters in Jindezhen to copy Ru pieces from the imperial collection. For long the copies have been confused with the originals.</p>
<p>The Guan (official) kilns were established in Hangzhou under direction of the Song court after they fled from northern invasion and lost access to the Ru and Jun kilns. Production is likely to have started after peace was largely restored in 1141. Guan ware has thin (1-3mm) body and thick (0.5-2.5mm) glaze applied in several layers, and the glaze can become thicker than the body. Since they are reduction fired, the bodies appear rather dark for their iron content (3-5%). Crackled glaze is common in Guan wares, which could be unintentional or deliberate, but regardless became highly desired later and frequently imitated. The best wares have wide crackles on greyish blue glaze, followed by those with denser crackles and in brown, green, or gray. Crackling is due to the glazes contracting more than the bodies in the process of cooling, and the low silica level in Guan wares contributes to their crackles. The multiple layers of glaze can develop independent crazing systems, enhancing the depth of the glaze. The wares were often stained to emphasize the crackles, though they also become darker through use or burial.</p>
<p>Longquan ware was produced from late Song to the Yuan and Ming and in such large volume that it eclipsed earlier celadon for a long time. These mass produced wares tend to be in simple shapes, sometimes with carved or molded decorations that are less elaborate than earlier examples. Their more austere aesthetics seems to reflect the new idea about classical refinement at the Song court. The clay has high iron content, and exposed clay turn red brown in the cooling process when fresh air is let in after reduction firing, turning the iron into red iron oxide. The level of standardization is high, though the color of the glaze varies from blue, jade green to olive and gray. In earlier wares the presence of air bubbles and unmelted particles create a softly glowing effect, and later wares in the Ming dynasty are transparent due to higher firing temperature. The first layer of glaze is applied before the bisque firing, and more layers are applied and refired to a high temperature (1230-1290°C). Longquan ware was exported along all trade routes in central, southern and south-east Asia, and along the African east coast. They were exported in large numbers to Japan, and several Japanese classifying terms like kinuta (pale bluish green wares), tenryuji (pea green wares), and shichikan (clear water green wares) became widely used. Towards the end of the Song period, the high demand made it difficult to maintain high production standards. Wares became larger and thicker, which helped surviving long distance trade routes. The peak of exports was reached in the Ming dynasty, before production declined due to competition from blue and white wares in Jingdezhen.</p>
<p>Korean celadon</p>
<p>Traditional Korean celadon was first produced and peaked in Koryu dynasty. Though high-fire green and brown stoneware was already being produced, the earliest “true” celadon wares were made in the end of 10th century AD. The close connection between Koryu wares and Chinese wares is apparent from the presence of Song wares in Koryo tombs. Yue wares produced in Zhejiang are likely to be a direct influence, as is shown by records of exchange of objects and potters between the regions. In early 12th century, Koryu ware saw a golden age marked by development of an original style, significant improvement in technique, and introduction of inlaying. Chinese forms and styles were adjusted to fit Korean taste, and inlaid wares became a central style. This prosperity continued into the first quarter of 13th century, and the decline in quality began before the Mongol invasion in 1231, which halted production completely. After work resumed in late 13th century, quality dipped further due to the impact of the war and Mongol occupancy. After the fall of Koryu dynasty in the end of 14th century, manufacturing technique for celadon was lost until it was rediscovered in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Glazes in Koryu celadon tend to resemble those in Longquan celadons. Due to imperfections in technique, they tend to be more varied in color, ranging from olive, green, to blue. Other features include a purple tint caused by the iron content in glaze or body, and brownish discoloration caused by accidental oxidation when the reducing atmosphere wasn’t maintained. Koryu potters used these properties to accentuate their designs, as the discoloration and running often produced a shading effect in vessels with relief, carved, or molded decoration.</p>

          <title>Dichroic Effect in Glass and Glaze</title>

            <p>Dichroic Effect in Glass and Glaze</p>
<p>There are many ways in the ceramic field to create a variety of colors and spectacular effects on glazes. However, when the kiln is opened, and the glazes are revealed, the color you see is the color you get… or is it? The awesome truth is no, the dichroic effects found in ancient glass have been rediscovered and augmented. Science and chemistry have explained the ancient mystery of how something can be seen as two different colors and dichromatic effects are now being utilized in the ceramic field.</p>
<p>Dichroic comes from the word dichroism which, according to Merriam-Webster 2019 edition dictionary, is a property some crystals and solutions demonstrate when they don’t absorb, transmit, and reflect polarized light planes equally. In other words, as you observe an object with true dichroism the observed color changes according to what is illuminating it and/or according to what light is bouncing off it. When observing reflected light (or the light that is being bounced back to you), the dichroic effect will show a completely different color from what you observe when seeing the transmitted light (or the light filtering through the object). A good example of this effect is found in a cup from Late Roman era, 4th century AD (Brill, 2019). This glass cup shows a green color when seeing the reflected light and a red color when seeing transmitted light.<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/dc5d6adff7d1fc7de3670b00902e9d16d589af10.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="vrrbKxuxB2Y31MzEpQ0iCWJbb4Q" width="159" height="169"></p>
<p>Another form of dichroism is glass that contains forms of rare earths and sometimes transition element oxides. These glasses only have the transmitted light qualities of dichroism. They Change color to the human eye depending on the type of light illuminating them. An example of this type can be found in Moser Glasses (Brill, 2019).<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/4a7481542537a2b9c66f9cb8a4f5151f492c0925.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="aCEWwRgOc6kVs4dm5lyiZsRgx0h" width="147" height="154"><br>
The more modern form of what we call dichroic is a bit removed from true dichroism, in that it is an interference filter adapted from a vacuum thin film deposition process discovered in 1887, and used by scientists at NASA in the 1950’s and 1960’s (Sandberg, 2019). It is a sort of scientific cheat in that they created a screen that blocks the passage of certain directional light waves. These glasses were layered with extremely thin films of metal oxides in order to shield the instruments on space craft from cosmic radiation and the eyes of astronauts from unfiltered sunlight (High Tech Art, 1993). Today there are many wider applications for dichroic films including fiber optics, laser guidance systems, art glass, and much more (Sandberg, 2019).<br>

In the mid 70’s an artist and engineer named Murray Schwartz was dumpster diving for rejected aerospace mirrors behind a GM Vacuum Coating Laboratory in Newport Beach, when he was confronted by an employee named Jerry Sandberg. This chance encounter led the two men to a research partnership that culminated in the first three dichroic color specific coatings. These color specific mirrors were spectacular however creating them was costly.<br>
<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/01b46bd3fb6dfafd625f814ef1b305330a2b9312.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="f51K4NjkcJTxCz8iBGkdXWxjGy" width="258" height="246"><br>
Eventually Schwartz ‘s wife, a glass fusing artist named Rupama, used a piece of their coated mirror glass in one of her glass fusing’s and the spectacular results spurred further experimentation with using dichroic coatings for other art applications and contributed to a flourishing business, selling dichroic coated glass to artists (Sandberg, 2019). The techniques Schwartz and Sandburg developed for achieving a wide range of colors in their dichroic glass are described on the Coatings by Sandberg website.</p>
<p>A breakthrough came for ceramic artists when Coatings by Sandberg introduced a product that separates the dichroic flash from its substrate creating a fine film on copper that can be removed and crushed into glitter to be applied directly to glass, plastic, and porcelain.</p>
<p>In an article written by John Conrad for Ceramic Arts Daily, Conrad shares different techniques for <a href="https://ceramicartsnetwork.org/pottery-making-illustrated/pottery-making-techniques/ceramic-decorating-techniques/glitter-flashing/#" rel="nofollow noopener">applying dichroic film to ceramic pottery</a>. This way of creating a dichroic effect on glaze uses dichroic glitter with a glue like medium of CMC Gum and water to stick the particles on to the surface of a finished piece of pottery. Once the CMC Gum is dry, a layer of clear glaze is carefully sprayed to cover the dichroic film and the piece is re-fired. The results from this create vessels with floating flecks of dichroic metal oxides sandwiched between layers of glaze. The results are more visible when applying the colorful metallic glitter to a glazed surface as they tend to be very subdued on white porcelain (Conrad, 2015).<img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/c01fbc173f1463504ae39c96f39f73f9a69a5df9.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rpBFgQ39iEn7AUo2E6GyxQWb4Zr" width="562" height="614"></p>
<p>The dichroic effect can also be achieved in creating glazes through an understanding of crystal field theory. A glaze formulation and technical manual for dichroic glazes, written by Jenn Wicks and Ryan Coppage, describes crystal field theory as a way of understanding electron valence systems that allows us to “change the color properties of a metal colorant or pigment based on the splitting of energy between orbitals”. In their book,  <em>The Mechanism of (and Recipes for) Dichroic Glazes</em>  (2019), Wicks and Coppage explain that,</p>
<p>The way in which we perceive the colors of transition metals has to do with how   photons (light) are absorbed [… ] Essentially, the surrounding glaze environment   encapsulates a metal, and oxygen atoms (or other components in the recipe) coordinate   themselves around the metal – typically in an octahedral or tetrahedral geometry. Based   on identity and arrangement of the surroundings, the electrons in the different d-orbitals   can experience energy repulsions, which causes a split in energy between the existing   orbitals. Such a change in energy, due to electrons not filling every orbital, allows for the   absorption of light of specific frequencies (photons); the rest is reflected off of the   surface, transmitted back to our eye, and is rebuilt into the color we see (p.147).</p>
<p>In their manual, Wicks and Coppage explore the dichroic responses rare earth oxides (neodymium oxide, erbium oxide, holmium oxide, and praseodymium oxide) have across different light sources. Their work shows that Neodymium oxide and Holmium oxide are the two rare earth oxides that have the most noticeable differences in color across different light sources when used in glaze formulations.<br>

From mysterious origins in ancient glassware where tiny amounts of colloidal gold and/or silver created a mystical color changing cup, to rare earth and transition element oxides, in the late 1800’s, creating radiation and light spectrum protection for astronauts, dichroic effects have captivated scientists and artists alike. Modern glaze chemistry and vacuum thin film deposition have enabled us to branch out of glass and into many other mediums with the spectacular and colorful effects of dichroism. When color variation, crystal formation, and the various textures of glazing aren’t enough, artists and potters alike can now enjoy the ambiguity of color like that of “the dress” only with much crisper and less ambiguous color shifts than washed out blue and black and with many more color options.<br>

          <title>The practice of stoneware glazes - D. De Montmollin</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[jpib]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Glaze Chemistry</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Daniel De Montmollin is a Swiss potter (and a monk, « Frère Daniel »), born in 1921. He is well-known in Europe (and particularly in France), for his work on high-fire glazes and ash glazes. At most of the ceramics schools in France, glazes are taught according to his books <em>Pratique des Emaux de grès</em>, 1987, and <em>Pratique des Emaux de Cendres</em>, 1997. Both books are now edited as a single volume by <em>La Revue de la Céramique et du Verre</em>, a French editor, and frequently out-of-print. There is an English version that may be easier to get at times than the French version, depending on stocks.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the main part of the first book, where he explains the principles and use of so-called <em>melting diagrams</em>. Follows 60 diagrams, with only sparse commentary on some diagram sets, more fitted to achieve certain glazes (celadons, oilspots …). Generally the book is clear, with an easy-to-read and down-to-earth approach.</p>
<p>I tried to merely paraphrase the book, without distorting too much the text. Graphics are taken from my version of the book, which happens to be French. I translated “fusion” to melting, which seems more appropriate. Italics show my own text, rather than a translation.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to fusion (melting) diagrams</strong></p>
<p>Melting diagrams are a particular “screening” for the potter of more general (and complex) <em>phase diagrams</em>, which are an attempt to describe what happens to a mix of oxides during firing. These diagrams are not easy to find and hard to understand for the layman (aka potter). As an example is reproduced the phase diagram of a CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 system, extracted from the <em>Phase Equilibrium Diagrams of Oxide Systems, vol. 1</em>, published by the American Ceramics Society. This same book has been used as the base for establishing the melting diagrams.</p>

<p>If a sailor wants to go to a specific island without having a sea map, he will not succeed. Thus the melting diagrams give the coordinates of 60 “treasure” islands where the potter can land if he chooses to. One diagram will “locate” the melting zone of a glaze, however it will tell nothing about how the glaze will look like because many other parameters are involved.</p>
<p>Melting diagrams show that melting is a relational event, which depends on the relationships between the glazes components, rather than on a single one (which would be called a “flux” - <em>see more on this below</em>). For a given set of oxides, there are several possible relationships that may lead to melting, at a given temperature. In particular, when changing the silica and alumina amounts in a glaze, while keeping the base mole unchanged, it is possible to maintain this glaze inside its melting zone. This zone is precisely what the diagrams are showing: for a specific base mole (<em>Seger’s formula first column</em>), all the SiO2 and Al2O3 ratios that may lead to the melting of the glaze. SiO2 is measured in 0.5 moles on the Y axis, while Al2O3 is given in 0.05 moles on the X axis (<em>see Fig.15 below</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Temperature contour</strong></p>
<p>Let’s imagine an alpinist who would like to go around a mountain, staying at an altitude of 1300 m. To do so, he will follow the 1300 m contour on his map, ignoring the other contours. Likely, the diagrams show only the 1300°C temperature contour, typical of glazes high-firing. The diagram below shows the melting behavior of a CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 system. By following the contour, we get the melting at 1300°C, while by getting inside the curve the melting will occur at lower temperatures. Note that the contour is interrupted at 1.5 SiO2. Under this value, melting can still occur, but silicates will not form properly.</p>

<p>Obviously, other contours could be drawn (like on a geographical map), as an example a more complete map of this system is given, with at the core the minimum temperature of 1165°C (eutectic of this system).</p>

<p>In fact the graph above looks more like one of a seabed than of a mountain. A side view would look like this:</p>

<p>This “seabed” metaphor emphasizes the fact that there is no clear-cut border between fired and unfired, as, on the bank of a lake, there is no clear border between wet and dry (notwithstanding the map accuracy). So it is by wandering from one side of the line to the other side that the potter will find the best melting properties of a specific glaze.</p>
<p><strong>The diagrams index</strong></p>
<p>The shape and width of the “lake” will obviously change with the base mole components.</p>
<p>The diagrams in the book are limited to all possible combinations of CaO, MgO and KNaO (i.e. K2O+Na2O), in tenths of moles, to compose the base mole. Which gives the following triangle map:</p>

<p>Ex: Diagram 20 is the one with 0.5 CaO, 0.3 MgO 0.2 KNaO.</p>
<p>The unnumbered points near MgO are combinations that are not melting at 1300°C.</p>
<p><strong>How to use the diagrams</strong></p>
<p><em>There are 4 exercises presented to demonstrate the use of the diagrams. Here are the two first ones.</em></p>
<p><strong>The cutting</strong></p>
<p>As the border between melted and not-melted is not a sheer line, the potter can do some “cuts” at several, well-separated regions of the diagrams to explore melting (here on diagram 27):</p>

<p><strong>The sweeping</strong></p>
<p>One can also explore more thoroughly the whole melting area of the diagram (here on diagram 18):</p>

<p><strong>The “flux” concept</strong></p>
<p>The term “flux” is often used by potters. But according to the diagrams, it is not really a proper term. For instance, let’s consider diagram 27, and mark points A and B, far from the melting zone of the glaze. For the glaze to melt, we have to come nearer the contour one way or another. For point A, we could decrease silica, which seems logical, since silica has a high melting point. But we could as well increase Al2O3, and by much, even if alumina is even more refractory than silica.  For point B, it’s the reverse. Decreasing alumina (which seems logical), but also increasing silica, which is not!</p>
<p>It shows that it is not an oxide alone that melts a glaze, but the relationship between oxides.</p>

<p><strong>Other topics in the introduction</strong></p>
<p><em>The rest of the introduction chapter provides succinct information about the influence of the firing length on melting, melting and atmosphere, melting and crawling, glaze melting adjustment, glazes overlay, etc</em> …</p>
<p><strong>Diagrams</strong></p>
<p><em>60 diagrams are reproduced, as per the triangular map.</em></p>
<p>Some diagrams have a vertical line, depending on the value of Al2O3 : this is the separation between glazes that can be made using feldspars, and glazes that can only be made using frits (because the alumina content is too low for a feldspar).</p>
<p><em>As an example, here is diagram 25. This is the De Montmollin representation of the Stull map.</em> For more information on the Stull map, go <a href="https://wiki.glazy.org/t/understanding-the-stull-chart/857">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Oil Spot Glazes</p>
<p>Rachel Davis<br>
Glaze Formulation<br>
Matt Katz<br>
August 9th, 2019</p>
<p>The aesthetic of the oil spot glaze has been captivating viewers since it was developed during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) in the Fujian province of China. Tea bowls with this highly prized surface were traded throughout east Asia, and the Japanese began developing their own glazes to mimic them.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[1]</a>In Japan, they were called Temmoku in reference to the Chinese mountain range Tianmu Shan. Generally speaking, the image that comes to mind when referring to a Temmoku glaze, is a deep brown or black that breaks over edges with a lighter reddish brown. But Temmoku can also refer to an entire glaze category, which includes glazes with striking effects such as the oil spot.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[2]</a>The potters of the Jianyang kilns in the Fujian province had specific methods for achieving this alluring glaze, which have been deciphered through excavation and analysis of sherds from the original kilns. Before attempting to understand how to create oil spot glazes today with modern technology, it is imperative to learn about this history and their technical choices. Much of the knowledge they had can be applied or modified to suit the needs of the modern potter.</p>
<p>In 2014, Pamela Vandiver and Chandra Reedy published an article on their findings from analyzing 30 sherds excavated by J.M. Plumer in 1935, from three kilns in Jianyang. They were able to determine information about glaze composition, application, and the firing process. It is important to note that the pieces they analyzed were not exclusively oil spots, but also included hare’s fur glazes. The significance of this fact is that no variation was found between the two in terms of glaze composition, meaning that the difference in the end product was due to variations in the firing process. All the glaze samples had a high iron content with calcium oxides, which had been applied to an iron-heavy body.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[3]</a>A high percentage of iron is one of the major keys to producing an oil spot glaze. When red iron oxide (Fe2O3) is heated, it converts to black iron oxide (FeO), releasing oxygen in the process. The calcium that is present in the glaze aids in breaking apart the iron and the oxygen.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[4]</a>When the oxygen bursts the surface of the glaze, it creates a crater. This occurrence is normally avoided by putting high iron glazes through an early reduction during the firing process. Starving the kiln of oxygen forces the chemically bonded oxygen in the red iron oxide to be released. When this happens before the glaze has begun melting, no oxygen bubbles will form and burst through the surface.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[5]</a>However, this “glaze flaw” is essential for creating the oil spot effect, which is why they must be fired in oxidation. The red iron oxide molecule will naturally release oxygen atoms at about 1230°C. This disrupts the homogeneity of the glaze, causing what is called phase separation.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[6]</a>When the oxygen leaves the glaze, a “spot” of iron remains.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[7]</a>As the firing continues, a layer of silica covers the blemished area, healing it. The potters in Jianyang had to be meticulous in their glaze application and firing techniques because viscosity and thickness plays an important role during this part of the glaze development in the kiln. Glaze thickness was around 3mm or more. If the glaze was applied too thinly, it would not produce a successful oil spot effect.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[8]</a>A certain balance must be achieved with the glaze viscosity. It must be stiff enough not to run, taking the iron spots with it. On the other hand, it cannot be so viscous that the oxygen bubbles fail to break the surface.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[9]</a>Historically these wares were glazed as greenware, placed on setters, and protected with a saggar as they were fired to 1230-1300°C. The saggar served to regulate both the temperature and the oxidation state.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[10]</a></p>
<p>Today, it is more common to apply the glaze to bisque ware rather than leather hard pots for increased durability during the final firing. And although the saggar method is still valid, it is not always necessary. For example, firing in an electric kiln provides an oxidation atmosphere without the threat of debris from the firing melting onto the surface. Another major development in recent years is the ability to obtain an oil spot effect with mid-range firing, albeit with some drawbacks. Spotting at this temperature tends to be smaller because of the lower temperature.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[11]</a>Another method for obtaining the oil spot look that works for both mid-range and high fire temperatures is using a slip-based glaze with a cover coat glaze. In this scenario, the cover glaze must melt first so the oxygen bubble can burst through it.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[12]</a>Traditional oil spot glazes tend to be variations of brown or black depending on the colorant. Brown, rusty colored spots come from iron oxide and darker blacks come from the addition of cobalt carbonate.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[13]</a>Although the cover glaze method is not the traditional way of creating the oil spot aesthetic, it uses the same principle of forming two glasses at different times during the firing. One glass must create bubbles to break through the other before it heals over. The difference here is that the two glasses come from two different glazes and is not due to phase separation of one glaze. This alternation in the process makes it simpler to explore a wider range of color possibilities with the cover coat.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[14]</a>Another interesting oil spot development is the usage of opacifiers such as zirconium silicate in glaze recipes. When the bubble bursts, the opacifier collects in the crater, creating white spots.<a href="https://wiki.glazy.org">[15]</a>This goes to show how a bit of knowledge and creativity can create a whole new branch of a glaze type.</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, the Jianyang potters mastered the oil spot glaze using the resources they had. The foundation of knowledge they amassed is one that potters continue to build on today. In the modern world, we are not limited to local materials as they were. Material accessibility makes it possible to explore the potential of oil spot glazes in ways that could not be done before. Continuing to analyze ceramics of the past while testing new glaze formulas and firing methods is certain to lead to more exciting developments for oil spot glazes in the future.</p>

<h2>UMF in Glazy</h2>
<p>Glazy currently has two types of UMF calculation: <strong>original/traditional</strong> as well as <strong>“extended”</strong>.</p>
<p>The “traditional” UMF adheres to the oxide groupings of RO/R2O,  R2O3, and RO2,  where RO/R2O are used for unity.  Any oxides not listed in those groups are simply listed as “OTHER”.</p>
<p>The “extended” UMF attempts to define roles for a broader range of oxides, for example CuO and CoO, that were previously viewed as secondary (e.g. “colorants”) and classified outside the unity as “other”.  This version of the UMF is still a work in progress.  It is based in part on the work of Matt Katz and Rose Katz.  (See Rose Katz’s 2019 NCECA Lecture “COLORFORMS” which discusses the roles of all major colorants.)</p>

          <title>Effect of clay on glaze coat cracking and thickness</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Pieter_Mostert]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Glaze Mixing &amp; Preparation</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The amount and types of clay in a glaze recipe can have a major effect on how the glaze applies to bisque when dipping. Below are two experiments that demonstate this effect. Feel free to add any other relevant experiments to the article.</p>
<p>The first experiment varies the percentages of two clays, <a href="https://glazy.org/materials/15512" rel="nofollow noopener">Kaolin G1</a>, and <a href="https://glazy.org/materials/19748" rel="nofollow noopener">B13 Ball Clay</a> (note that Kaolin G1 isn’t really a kaolin). The left and right glazes contain 16% Kaolin G1 and 16% B13 Ball Clay respectively, were formulated to have the same chemistry, and both had a specific gravity of 1.52 to begin with.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/488f0da31c08f148c48e0d3d5dafb12e3967745f.jpeg" alt="Kaolin%20G1%20vs%20B13%20ball" width="327" height="222"><br>
Tiles were dipped for 10 seconds three times, and then for 15 seconds, with 2 days between dips to ensure that they were completely dry. Tiles that showed excessive cracking weren’t dipped the full number of times. Since the tiles were lowered face-down into the glaze, pinholes from the first dip trapped air that resulted in larger craters in subsequent dips.</p>

<p>After each dip, the thickness of the glaze coat was recorded. These measurements are only approximate.</p>
<p><img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/3976682afc677fe87199d14d144352149d64401f.jpeg" alt="Glaze%20thickness%20KaolinG1%20B13" width="322" height="147"><br>
The tests show that replacing Kaolin G1 with B13 Ball Clay leads to a decrease in application thickness, and initially a decreasing in cracking (it might not be clear in the image above, but in the bottom row, the 16% B13 Ball Clay test shows a crack on the top edge, while the other two tests are crack-free)</p>
<p>The second test is a line blend from 4% B13 Ball Clay to 20% B13 Ball Clay, from left to right, in 4% increments.</p>

All glazes were formulated to have the same chemistry, and had an initial specific gravity of 1.57 (This probably increased after each dip, but wasn’t measured). Here the sequence of dipping times was 15s, 10s, 10s, with at least two days between dips.</p>

            <p>Mirror Black recipe is found to be have the best reflective properties as the recipe is found on <a href="https://glazy.org/recipes/11043" rel="nofollow noopener">Glazy</a>. After altering many different aspects of the recipe the original seems to work the best for what I was using it for in reflecting neon tube lighting. It has great reactions on non-flat surfaces in altering the light. Applied by dipping or brush strokes did not seem to affect the effect by much as long as it is applied thick either way. When thin, Mirror Black it not reflective and is a brown color.</p>

            <h1>Firing Schedules</h1>
<h3>peter pinnell on tue 26 mar 96</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi David,<br>
From my experience, a slow cooling actually helps copper reds, making<br>
them deeper and more transparent. The huge kilns that the Chinese used<br>
to produce copper reds during the Ching Dynasty took WEEKS to cool, not<br>
days.<br>
I would guess that the reason you’re not getting red is that either you<br>
are not beginning your reduction soon enough, or there is too thin a<br>
glaze application. Either of these can result in the result you described.<br>
Firing and application requirements vary depending on the formula of the<br>
glaze, but generally I would say that reduction should begin by about<br>
Orton cone 012. This is quite a bit earlier than is required by most<br>
glazes, but that is because these high alkalie, low alumina formulas<br>
begin to flux at a much earlier point.Once these glazes melt, they are<br>
hard to reduce. The spaces in the glaze matrix are just too small for<br>
the reduction molecules to penetrate, kind of like trying to push<br>
basketballs through a screen door.<br>
During the firing, a copper red separates into several distinct layers.<br>
Between the body and the glaze a layer of anorthite and wollastonite<br>
crystals grow that provide a white backround for the glaze. Above that<br>
is a red layer that is made up of a liquid/liquid phase seperation:<br>
globules of red glass floating in a transparent glaze. Above it all is a<br>
thin, clear layer. If the glaze is applied too thinly, the first layer to<br>
go is the red one. It is possible to produce even more layers by adding<br>
a small amount of zinc, which adds tiny orange flects, and titania, which<br>
pushes the glaze towards blue.<br>
Are you using the same kind of burners that you used before? Are you<br>
measuring reduction? It could just be that you are not getting as much<br>
reduction as you think.<br>
Good luck.<br>
Pete Pinnell<br>
P.S. I had the best luck with copper carbonate, in a ration of one to<br>
three with tin oxide. ( .33 % copper carb to 1.0% tin oxide)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Linda Arbuckle on thu 20 nov 97</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Pete Pinnell gave an excellent workshop at ClayFactory in Tampa several<br>
years back, and fired a bunch of copper reds at U to Tampa. He<br>
demonstrated that his method of early reduction (beginning at cone 010),<br>
then neutral up to almost temperature followed by at least 20 minutes of<br>
oxidizing produces beautiful copper reds. What I was taught to do, a<br>
“glaze reduction” at cone 9 or 10, didn’t matter and just wasted fuel.</p>
<p>At UF we have a small gas test kiln, so that I could try this at home<br>
cautiously and see if I could get the same results as a “trained<br>
professional” in copper reds. Worked fine. As Pete pointed out, thick<br>
enough glaze application and a good glaze are also needed, but not a<br>
second reduction.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cazo.mehmeti" rel="nofollow noopener">Čazo Čazim Mehmeti</a> When I communicated with ALS Global I told them that I need chemical analysis expressed in the % oxide form. I sent them example of Neph. Sy. and everything was clear.</p>
<p>But, they make CA with Portable XRF instrument (pXRF). That means results can vary 5 - 20%(!?), and that range is if instrument is used correctly. That is for each element. Like for the copper, and for the oxygen. So, what is the error when they bond Cu and O together?</p>
<p>From portable XFR manual:<br>
“Method precision is the amount the value of a data<br>
point from a single measurement may deviate within a range due<br>
to uncertainties in the analytical method in use. In pXRF analysis,<br>
method precision may range from 5 to 20% when the instrument<br>
is used correctly and a robust QAQC program is in place. This is on<br>
par with exploration geochemistry and indicative methods, but it is<br>
much poorer than that of the assay techniques used for financially<br>
sensitive data (1.5 to 5%, or even less). This difference in precision<br>
should always be taken into account when comparing pXRF results<br>
to traditional assay results done on the same material. For example,<br>
a letter of credit for a banking institution requires a definitive result,<br>
such as 22.34% copper content, while pXRF results may be stated as<br>
20% ± 5% copper content.”</p>

            <p>The specific gravity of a dry material is its weight divided by the weight of water it displaces. <a href="https://wiki.glazy.org/t/brongniarts-formula/780">Brongniart’s formula</a> depends on the specific gravity of the dry materials in a glaze recipe, although for most glazes, this is about 2.6.</p>
<p>If there was no air trapped between the particles of a powdered material, the weight of water (in grams) displaced by a given batch of that material would be equal to the volume of the batch (in millilitres). However, because powdered materials do contain air, the weight of water they displace is somewhat less than their volume.</p>
<h3>List of specific gravities</h3>
<p>(This needs to be expanded. Ideally the specific gravities should be given together with a source, which can be from a spec sheet or an actual measurement)</p>

<h3>Measuring specific gravity</h3>
<p>Fill half a graduated cylinder with water, and note the volume. Add 100g of the material you’re interested in to the graduated cylinder, and stir until there are no more bubbles (Wear a respirator and use good ventilation when working with powdered glaze materials). Note the volume of the mixture in the graduated cylinder. The specific gravity of the material is 100 divided by the difference in volume, measured in millilitres.</p>
<h3>Calculating the specific gravity of a recipe</h3>
<p>If a recipe contains materials with parts by weight <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>2</sub>, …,<em>w</em><sub>n</sub>, and specific gravities <em>s</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>2</sub>, …,<em>s</em><sub>n</sub>, respectively, then its specific gravity is<br>

            <p>This is a formula for determining the quantity of dry materials in a given quantity of glaze slurry. It is named after the former director of the Sèvres Porcelain Factory, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Brongniart" rel="nofollow noopener">Alexandre Brongniart</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of equivalent ways of expressing Brongniart’s formula. If <em>S</em><sub>wet</sub>, <em>M</em><sub>wet</sub>, and <em>V</em><sub>wet</sub> are the specific gravity, mass, and volume of the slurry, and  <em>S</em><sub>dry</sub>, <em>M</em><sub>dry</sub>, and <em>V</em><sub>dry</sub> are the specific gravity, mass, and volume<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://wiki.glazy.org#footnote-1169-1" id="footnote-ref-1169-1">[1]</a></sup> of the dry glaze materials, then<br>

<em>S</em><sub>wet</sub>, <em>M</em><sub>wet</sub>, and <em>V</em><sub>wet</sub> can be measured, and for most glazes, <em>S</em><sub>dry</sub> is around 2.6 (exceptions are glazes which contain substantial amounts of tin or lead.). See the entry on the <a href="https://wiki.glazy.org/t/specific-gravity-of-glaze-materials/781">specific gravity of dry materials</a> for a list of values.</p>
<p>If one substitutes <em>S</em><sub>dry</sub> = 2.6 into (2), the equation can be rewritten as<br>

For example, 2kg of a glaze slurry with specific gravity 1.5 contains<br>

<p>This requires the weight of the glaze slurry in the bucket, the weight of a syringeful of glaze slurry, and the weight of a syringeful of water (the ratio of the last two measurements gives the specific gravity of the glaze slurry). In theory, the weight of a syringeful of water in grams should equal volume of the syringe in millilitres, but syringes may be inaccurate. The default for the specific gravity of the dry materials is 2.6, but this can be changed.</p>
