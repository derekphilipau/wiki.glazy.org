<p>Sunday, September 30th, 2007</p>
<p>I prefer to spray my glazes. When done correctly, this method can create a smooth and very even coating of glaze. This way you don’t wind up looking at the piece after it is fired, wondering whether “that effect/defect” on one side is a result of a heavier or thinner application. Brushing and dipping can certainly be done with accuracy and has it’s own advantages, but spray glazing is still my preference.</p>
<p>When spraying, I place a piece on a banding wheel (I think Shimpo makes the best), and apply each glaze layer to the point where it stops drying… this will be just before it starts to run. I wait until the glaze sets up again (the watery sheen disappears) before spraying the next coat, so as not to distort the surface with the pressure coming out of the gun. But don’t let the layer dry completely, as you risk the first layer(s) bubbling/lifting up off the pot as it rehydrates. This “dry -but not too dry” rule applies to any application method, by the way.</p>
<p>Whether spraying, dipping, or brushing, I test the thickness of my glaze application with a push pin marked in millimeter increments (1-3mm) and record that in my notes. Many people use this method for testing glaze application thickness. The first time I read about this simple technique, was in the book “Ceramic Technology for Potter’s and Sculptor’s” (Cuff, 1996). John Tilton brought a  <em>depth gauge</em>  (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a  <em>micrometer</em> ), specially machined for testing glazes, to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110123052411/http://jessehull.com/2006/05/13/kris-friedrichs-peter-ilsley-workshop/" rel="nofollow noopener">Peter Ilsley Workshop</a> in 2006.</p>

<p>Concerning spray guns, I’ve had acceptable results with many types, but I think HVLP works best. I buy these from a place like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110123052411/http://www.harborfreight.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Harbor Freight</a>, my reason being that paint guns weren’t made to have abrasive glaze particles passing through them. In this regard, I’ve found that more expensive guns wear out just as fast under this type of (ab)use, so I buy the “cheapies” and treat them as disposable (actually, my most recent 3 have lasted over a year).</p>
<p>I also recommend gravity feed models… otherwise, you’ll have glaze left in the canister of the “bottom feeder” models, as they, well… don’t do all that good a job of feeding off the bottom… <img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/uploads/default/original/1X/c780e395059a8e0dcd430a029eb634655c8f86e8.gif" alt=";)" width="15" height="15"></p>
<p>Incorporating additives such as suspension agents and binders to enhance the glaze’s storage and dry handling properties is a good idea. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110123052411/http://jessehull.com/2007/09/29/glaze-suspension-binder-products-i-use/" rel="nofollow noopener">Click here for this info</a>.</p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
<h3>Smudging</h3>
<p><em>Robin M. MacKay:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve tried Aftosa and whatever Highwater sells. The problem is it doesn’t seem to get hard enough to handle. Sometimes bits of it stick to my fingers pulling off a very thin layer of glaze with it causing a blotchy surface…even if I wait a day. Here’s a pic of what I mean. I need something that dries hard enough to hold onto…been thinking about acrylic medium. Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Eric Newman:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things I’ve found that help: let the resist dry for at least a day; add a hardener (e.g., CMC) to the glaze so it isn’t dusty; dust fingers with corn starch so they aren’t as tacky.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Types</h2>
<h3>Hot wax</h3>
<h4>Mixing parafin with kerosene:</h4>
<p><em>Bill Merrill via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of ease of use, most potters use Aftosa wax resist. I have a very well ventilated studio thathas large doors open so the studio is like its outside. I use Aftosa, but prefer a mixture of kerosene and paraffin. I melt the wax in an electric frying pan and add kerosene to the mix. I use it at 280 degrees test the mix on a piece of broken bisque ware. If it is too greasy, I add some more wax. It by liquid volume. The kerosene is less than the wax by volume. If it doesnt brush well (using a brush that holds wax easily) I add a little more kerosene. This should not be done with an open burner, as the mixture could ignite! This wax is super resistant to glaze.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Vince Pitelka via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a studio potter in the last century I did all my waxing with hot paraffin, but did not like the way the pure wax brushed on so I thinned it a bit with kerosene.  I built a special fume hood over the wax pot so I wouldn’t die from the fumes and I set the pot at 180 degrees - no hotter.  A better solution is to thin the wax with mineral oil - that way the fumes are no more toxic than the wax itself, but you still shouldn’t be breathing it.  You can experiment with the amount of mineral oil added to the wax and find the happy spot where you get a durable coat but it brushes on to your satisfaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Safely heating the wax</h4>
<p><em>Kathi Lesueur via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also use a small electric frying pan for my wax. I dont thing anything beats hot wax when youve put one glaze on a pot and want to mask out an area before pouring another on. One thing I have learned is to bring the temperature up slowly. Turn it on at a low setting.<br>
When the wax has completely melted turn it up about five degrees. Then another five until you reach the temperature that is optimum. If you turn it on high right from the beginning you are guaranteed to have smoking wax. And, as Bonnie said, keep that lid close. The same goes with a fire on the stove. Baking soda will put a flame out. But, a lid is far faster. Keep one handy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Fire Hazard</h4>
<p><em>Bill Merrill via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you use the hot wax be very cautious of the heat and fumes. I know a potter who was working with a regular frying pan and the wax ignited. He used pliers to get the pan out of the studio. He really burned his hands, so be extra cautious if you try this old fashioned wax resist.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I always keep the lid to the electric fry pan nearby when using hot wax. If a fire starts, using a hot pad, put the lid on the fry pan which should extinguish the flames immediately. Carrying a flaming pot of wax is asking for disaster as the wax could spill spreading the fire further. When<br>
heating my paraffin, I use just the highest WARM temperature and if still too thick, then add the oil until it becomes the right melt at that temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Shellac</h3>
<p><em>Walter Ivan Heath:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You need the glaze/body to be dry with shellac, thin it with denatured alcohol so it flows well through a Japanese brush…it drys very quickly…it’s wonderful stuff, I use it with mica pigments on my drums…it will even stick to Formica, nothing else will</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Liquid Latex</h3>
<p><em>J. B. Clauson via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I purchase liquid latex at local art supply houses. It paints on easily and peels off just as easily. I use it when I want fine control over the area I want left uncovered. I have not tried to cut a shape after painting it on to see if it will peel easily, leaving the decoration in tact.<br>
Down side - if you leave liquid latex on pot when you fire, it burns off ok and doesnt seem to cause any ill effects in the final firing - but, boy, does it stink when it burns off. Probably really noxious stuff, so I avoid putting it in the kiln if t all possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Cat Jarosz via Clayart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Liquid Latex is great stuff but it has a few rules… you need murphys oil soap for your brush or you wont have a brush left after your done and you should thin out the latex with water first… fool around with how much as you may be able to get away with really thin depending on what your doing its also easier to use the thinner it is. ps dip your brush in murphys oil soap before you begin then go for it …</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Water-based latex</h3>
<p>Recommended by Mickey Fielding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Water-base latex, bar none, for things that no wax, acrylic, or shellac can accomplish. I’ll be happy to share my tips for using it and not ruining brushes. <img src="https://wiki.glazy.org/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"> BTW, it’s also perfect for masking over textured surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Brands</h2>
<h3>Michelman Wax Resist</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.baileypottery.com/Bailey-Pottery/Product-Details/%20MICHELMAN-WAX-RESIST-C042103" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.baileypottery.com/Bailey-Pottery/Product-Details/%20MICHELMAN-WAX-RESIST-C042103</a></p>
<h3>Forbes</h3>
<p>Forbes is a water-based wax that has a milky, translucent quality. It’s really good for waxing the bottoms of pots and rims. The brushing quality is great and it dries very quickly. Forbes can be used on greenware for single firing and bisqueware. Once dry, it has a firm non-sticky surface that resists glazes very well. Any glaze that does stick to the wax cleans up quickly with a damp sponge. If the wax is hard to see after it has dried, try adding some food coloring. Just mix a little dye right in with the wax, it will be easier to tell where wax has been applied. The color will burn out during the firing.<br>

<h3>Mobilcer A</h3>
<p>Mobilcer A is a solvent-free mix of wax and emulsion. Mobilcer wax is thicker and more opaque than Forbes wax. It can be thinned with a small amount of water to improve brushability. If you want to do wax resist glazing with multiple glazes, Mobilcer is the best choice. Forbes wax will not stick to an unfired glazed surface. It will peel up after a few minutes. Mobile, on the other hand, will stick to an unfired glaze and resist subsequent glaze layers. Because it is thicker than Forbes, Mobilcer wax takes a little longer to dry and stays a bit tacky. Be careful not to put the wax on excessively thick, a thin coat will do and help it dry quicker. If your wax separates during storage, shake well before using.<br>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Spraying glaze is a fairly complicated process.  There are craftspeople in Jingdezhen whose only job is going from workshop to workshop spraying glaze.  There are so many factors involved with spraying (the type of work, thickness of work, type of glaze, glaze consistency, air pressure, spray head type, even weather) that it requires years of experience to be able to master the art.</p>
<p>I hope to slowly add to this article in the future.  For now I will just lay out the basics of how I spray glaze.</p>
<h2>The Spraying Booth</h2>
<p>My spray booth is made locally in Jingdezhen.  It’s a simple stainless steel frame with glass.  A large fan is attached to the back, sucking out particles.  Water is pumped from a bucket through a hose that leads to the top of the booth interior.  The water is channelled along the top of the glass and then exits through small holes, forcing the water to run down the glass, washing away glaze.  The water finally exits through a hole in the bottom of the spray booth, pouring back into the water bucket.</p>

<p>On top of the turntable I place a plaster disk. The added weight results in more even turning, while the plaster absorbs glaze. A notch in the plaster helps with counting revolutions. After spraying, glaze can be scraped off and collected.<br>

<h2>The Air Compressor</h2>
<p>I have an old, noisy air-tank compressor that I rarely use.  I much prefer the Jingdezhen method- a cheap magnetic air compressor used in fish tanks.  I’ve used my current compressor for six years and it still runs great, with no need to worry about adding oil or filtering the outgoing air.</p>
<p>I’ve found that a 520W compressor is ideal.  In the past I had a smaller compressor that didn’t spray as well.</p>
<p>The sprayer does a great job of mimicking traditional Jingdezhen glaze spraying using just the breath.  A normal air compressor using a paint sprayer head will give you a finely atomized cloud of glaze resulting in a powdery glaze application.  But a traditional mouth sprayer connected to the fish tank compressor will give you relatively large glaze droplets that soak into the clay, leaving a more compact glaze application.</p>
<p>The fish tank compressor method also sprays less glaze into the air.  I often just run the water pump and leave the booth fan off (but of course I wear a good respirator).</p>
<p>Note that this type of spraying results in more water being absorbed into the ware.  Especially for thin pieces, care needs to be taken not to overload the ware with water.  I usually spray the outsides one day and the insides the next, giving the ware sufficient drying time in-between sprays.</p>
<p><em>If while spraying you notice the glaze stays wet and shiny on the surface it means you are either spraying too close or have already reached saturation.  This is bad.  There’s a good chance that the entire glaze layer will separate from the ware.</em></p>
<p>My air compressor is actually just a cheap fish tank pump. It’s much quieter than normal air-tank compressors.<br>

<h2>Mouth sprayers</h2>
<p>The glaze sprayers widely used in Jingdezhen were originally meant to be sprayed using only one’s mouth.  Since then, the mouth stem has been modified from conical (larger end towards mouth) to tapered at both ends for a tight fit into an air compressor hose.</p>
<p>Making these sprayers is a specialized craft.  The sprayers come in dozens of different configurations.  The sizes of the container, nozzle, and mouth stem as well as the distances between these parts, all determine the characteristics of the spray pattern.  In general, larger containers are used for larger work (e.g. sculpture), while the smallest containers are used for spraying underglazes and details.</p>

<p>Like Jingdezhen glaze canisters, the Paasche allows you to make fine adjustments in distance between the nozzle and container tube.  Along with adjusting air pressure and glaze thickness, a number of different spray patterns can be achieved.<br>
Spraying<br>
It’s difficult to write about actually spraying glaze, because each session is different.  The basic process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spray outsides.  Do not rest ware directly on turntable or plaster disc, but rather elevate it with a stable item such as a smaller plaster column.  If the inside is already glazed, on top of the support you can add a sponge disk.</li>
<li>After spraying the bottom, you can scrape glaze off of the feet.<br>
Ideally, wait one day while the bottoms dry completely.  If in a rush, blow air over the ware with a fan.</li>
<li>Spray insides.  Take care that feet are not resting on a surface that will become wet during glazing.  The dry plaster turntable disk helps with this issue.</li>
<li>Clean glaze off the feet by trimming or with a sponge.</li>
</ul>
<p>To spray:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a notch in the turntable disk as a guide, keep a mental note of how many revolutions you make and the resulting thickness of the glaze (checked by scraping).  The number of revolutions will vary each glaze session, and is influenced by the glaze canister, air pressure, glaze consistency, size of ware, etc.</li>
<li>Keep the glaze canister in constant, steady motion- up &amp; down, side to side, or circular.  You may need to vary the motion to get consistent application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a toilet brush for mixing up the glaze each time I fill the canister<br>

<p>It’s difficult to see in this photo, but the center of this dish was trimmed thin, and the sprayed glaze has saturated the ware. The surface of the glaze is no longer powdery. Stop spraying.<br>
